# From Manual Checks to Implicit Guards

:::

Generic programming in C++ dates back to 1991 when templates were introduced into the language (C++ Release 3.0). Stroustrup's primary motivation for designing templates was to replace C preprocessor macros with type-safe generic containers. In *The Design and Evolution of C++*, he wrote that macros "fail to obey scope and type rules and don't interact well with tools," whereas templates were designed to be "as efficient as macros" but type safe<RefLink :id="1" preview="Stroustrup, The Design and Evolution of C++, 1994, Ch.15" />.

But the story took an unexpected turn in 1994. Erwin Unruh presented a piece of valid C++ code at a C++ committee meeting that wouldn't even compile, yet the compiler output a sequence of prime numbers line by line in the error messages<RefLink :id="2" preview="Unruh, Prime Number Computation, C++ committee meeting, 1994" />. The entire committee realized that templates had inadvertently constituted a Turing-complete system for compile-time computation. The following year, Todd Veldhuizen published a paper systematically describing this technique and named it **Template Metaprogramming**<RefLink :id="3" preview="Veldhuizen, Using C++ Template Metaprograms, C++ Report, 1995" />. Thus, templates evolved from a "type-safe macro replacement" to an indispensable compile-time abstraction mechanism in C++.

Template error messages often span hundreds of lines and are notoriously unreadable—this is why many C++ developers shy away from generic programming. However, as project scale grows, code without generics becomes so repetitive that it's hard to maintain. In this article, we start from the basic motivation of generic programming and work our way to a concrete, actionable type safety issue—implicit narrowing conversion.

## First, let's clarify what generic programming is actually trying to achieve

The effect of generic programming is to make code more general and more abstract—this is only half right. Alex Stepanov (father of the STL) pointed out that the goal of generic programming is to "express ideas in the most general, efficient, and flexible way," and the key is expressing ideas, not abstraction for abstraction's sake. Treating means as ends is a common pitfall in programming—another typical example is the abuse of design patterns.

This distinction is important. We don't design code starting from an abstract model; we start from concrete, efficient algorithms, discover commonalities, and then extract them. Moreover, performance cannot be sacrificed, as a large part of C++'s significance lies in this. As hardware gets stronger, our expectations for software are skyrocketing, while semiconductor processes seem to have hit a bottleneck, leaving less and less room for sloppy coding.

Generic programming demands more from us: it requires us to see reusable patterns in abstract domains. And its bottom line is—after abstraction, performance must not be worse than a hand-written specific version. Otherwise, there is no point in introducing generic programming. Writing code itself is about getting the job done; don't do unnecessary work. If a piece of code won't be reused and is performance-sensitive, don't introduce generics.

## Alex Stepanov's C++ design criteria

Stepanov proposed three design criteria around 1994<RefLink :id="4" preview="Stepanov & Lee, The Standard Template Library, HP Labs, 1995" />: first is generality, good generic components should express usages even the designer didn't think of; second is uncompromising efficiency, writing system-level code in C++ should match C, and linear algebra should match Fortran; third is statically typed interfaces, checked at compile time, not leaving errors to runtime. Later, he added two very practical requirements: compile time shouldn't be so long that one can go for coffee (header-only libraries find this hard to guarantee), and the learning curve shouldn't be so steep that it requires a MIT PhD to get started<RefLink :id="5" preview="Nygaard, cited in Stroustrup, Concept-Based Generic Programming in C++, 2025, §1" />—as for whether C++ achieved this, everyone knows the answer.

## Implicit Narrowing Conversion: A Classic Type Safety Trap

With the motivation out of the way, let's start with a specific problem. The introduction of a concept must have a corresponding problem scenario, otherwise, it's a castle in the air. Look at this code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int big = 30000;
    short small = big;          // 30000 超出了 short 的范围吗？其实没有，short 一般是 -32768~32767
                                // 但如果是 40000 呢？

    short overflow = 40000;     // 编译通过！但值已经错了

    double pi = 3.14159;
    int int_pi = pi;            // 小数部分直接丢了

    std::cout << "overflow = " << overflow << "\n";  // 输出一个奇怪的负数
    std::cout << "int_pi = " << int_pi << "\n";      // 输出 3

    return 0;
}
```

This code uses C++23 syntax to ensure all compilers can compile it directly.

On my machine, the result is `overflow = -25536`, `int_pi = 3`. The compiler doesn't give a single warning (unless you turn on `-Wall -Wextra`, but many projects don't). This kind of bug is particularly insidious: the code runs, but the result is wrong, and it often doesn't show up when data volumes are small, only surfacing after going live.

Many people think "this is just a C++ feature, just be careful." But relying on human diligence is unreliable. Bjarne Stroustrup himself said he wanted to solve this problem back then but couldn't, and the C camp wouldn't let him change it. So as users, can we prevent it ourselves?

## Using C++20 concepts to model "Numbers"

C++20 gives us a new weapon: concepts. Its essence is simple—a concept is a compile-time evaluated boolean predicate, input is a type, output is true or false. Another way to put it: it lets the compiler understand a "concept" without us needing to describe it in complex natural language.

The standard library already defines some basic concepts, like `std::integral` and `std::floating_point`, which judge whether a type is an integer type or a floating-point type. These aren't new inventions; the first edition of K&R C distinguished between int and float, but now we have a language-level, compile-time queryable representation.

Let's first write a simple concept to express the concept of "number":

```cpp
#include <concepts>
#include <type_traits>

// 我自己的 "number" concept：要么是整数，要么是浮点数
template<typename T>
concept number = std::integral<T> || std::floating_point<T>;

// 验证一下
static_assert(number<int>, "int 应该是 number");
static_assert(number<double>, "double 应该是 number");
static_assert(number<char>, "char 也是整数类型，所以是 number");
static_assert(!number<std::string>, "string 不是 number");
```

There is a syntactic detail worth explaining here: `std::integral<T>` looks like a function call, but it isn't. `std::integral` is a concept, `<T>` instantiates it with type T, and the value of the whole expression is a compile-time bool. You can't write `std::integral(T)`, that syntax is wrong. Just understand it as "perform the integral test on T", returning true or false.

Running the code above, all four `static_assert` pass, indicating our `number` concept basically works.

## Write a narrowing judgment by hand

Can we write a concept to judge "when assigning a value of type U to type T, will a narrowing conversion occur"? Since I'm writing this article.

First, if T's representation range is smaller than U's, narrowing is obviously possible. For example, assigning `int` to `short`, `int` can represent many more values than `short`. But how to judge "smaller range"? The C++ standard library doesn't directly give us a concept for "type's value range", but `<type_traits>` has `std::numeric_limits`, which can query the min and max of various types. If U is floating-point and T is integer, the fractional part will definitely be lost, this is also narrowing.

There's another easily overlooked situation: U and T are both integers, the size is the same (e.g., both 32-bit), but signedness differs, then assigning a negative number to an unsigned type will also cause problems. Writing these rules into code:

```cpp
#include <concepts>
#include <type_traits>
#include <limits>

template<typename T>
concept number = std::integral<T> || std::floating_point<T>;

// 判断 T 是否"比 U 小"（能表示的值更少）
// 这里用 numeric_limits 的范围来比较
template<typename T, typename U>
concept smaller_range =
    number<T> && number<U> &&
    (std::numeric_limits<T>::max() < std::numeric_limits<U>::max() ||
     std::numeric_limits<T>::min() > std::numeric_limits<U>::min());

// 核心判断：从 U 到 T 的赋值是否会发生窄化
template<typename T, typename U>
concept narrowing_assign =
    number<T> && number<U> &&
    (
        // 情况1：T 的范围比 U 小，可能放不下
        smaller_range<T, U> ||
        // 情况2：U 是浮点数，T 是整数，小数部分会丢
        (std::floating_point<U> && std::integral<T>) ||
        // 情况3：U 和 T 大小相同但有符号性不同
        (std::integral<T> && std::integral<U> &&
         std::signed_integral<U> != std::signed_integral<T>)
    );

// 测试用例
static_assert(narrowing_assign<short, int>, "int -> short 应该是窄化");
static_assert(narrowing_assign<int, double>, "double -> int 应该是窄化（丢小数）");
static_assert(narrowing_assign<unsigned int, int>, "int -> unsigned int 可能窄化（负数问题）");
static_assert(!narrowing_assign<int, short>, "short -> int 不是窄化");
static_assert(!narrowing_assign<double, float>, "float -> double 不是窄化");
static_assert(!narrowing_assign<int, int>, "int -> int 不是窄化");
```

Compile and run, all six `static_assert` pass. We can use the last `!narrowing_assign<int, int>` to verify the logic: assigning the same type, in case 1, `smaller_range<int, int>` in `max() < max()` is false, `min() > min()` is also false, so it doesn't trigger; case 2 requires U is floating-point and T is integer, not satisfied; case 3 requires signedness differs, `int` and `int` are obviously the same. All three branches are false, the whole thing is false, negated `static_assert` passes—this matches our intuition that "same type assignment doesn't narrow".

One more thing worth mentioning: where `&&` and `||` are mixed in `narrowing_assign`, parentheses must be added. Because `&&` has higher precedence than `||`, without parentheses, `number<T> && number<U>` only constrains the first `||` branch, and the latter two branches might be evaluated on non-number types—although the result happens to be correct for current test cases, semantically it's wrong. Adding parentheses makes the three branches a whole, then uniformly constrained by `number<T> && number<U>`, the logic is rigorous.

## Some edge cases need to be thought through

The implementation above covers most scenarios, but there are details worth mentioning. For example, conversion between floating-point numbers: `double` to `float`, does it count as narrowing? From a precision perspective, of course, because `double` can represent more significant digits than `float`. But in the current implementation, `smaller_range<float, double>` will judge `numeric_limits<float>::max() < numeric_limits<double>::max()`, which is true, so it will be correctly identified as narrowing.

Another example is `char` to `unsigned char`. The signedness of `char` is implementation-defined (signed on some platforms, unsigned on others). If `char` is signed on the platform, then `signed_integral<char> != signed_integral<unsigned char>` is true, and it will be identified as narrowing. This is actually reasonable, because if `char` is -1, assigning it to `unsigned char` becomes 255.

However, note that this implementation is not 100% rigorous. The standard's definition of narrowing conversion (in C++11 list initialization rules) is more detailed than what's written here, for example, considering whether the value is within the integer range when converting from floating-point to integer. But as a starting point, this concept can already block most pitfalls for us. It can be improved gradually.

At this point, we can summarize one thing: concepts aren't some profound metaprogramming trick, they are just a mechanism to "write constraints on types as compile-time checkable boolean expressions". Previously when writing templates, constraints relied entirely on documentation and naming conventions (e.g., "please pass a random access iterator"), the compiler didn't care, if you passed the wrong thing, it would spit out a pile of gibberish. Now with concepts, the compiler can tell you "the type you passed doesn't meet the requirements" immediately, and the error message is human-readable.

The next step is to apply this `narrowing_assign` concept to actual functions to make a safe assignment wrapper—this is the content of the next section. At least the core idea of "using concepts to express type constraints" is sorted out here.

# From Manual Checks to Implicit Guards: Stuffing Narrowing Checks into Types

In the previous section, we figured out the judgment rules for narrowing conversion. If you run these rules through your head every time you write code, it's almost impossible—when signed and unsigned are mixed, which one is bigger, will it overflow, can the positive part be represented, just thinking about these is dizzying. The speaker said writing this thing out by hand takes about a page, and it's very messy and tricky.

So the task for this section is: turn that page of messy logic into real running code, and then hide it so you don't feel its existence when writing code normally.

## First, translate the judgment logic into code

An intuition is: to judge whether assigning a value from type U to type T will cause narrowing, just use a `static_cast` and compare. But think carefully, that's not it at all—when signed and unsigned are mixed, the comparison itself has traps. So we need an honest, step-by-step function.

The idea is: do as much exclusion work as possible at compile time, filtering out those situations where "narrowing absolutely cannot happen", leaving only the paths that really need runtime checking. This is actually what generic programming emphasizes—don't do work at runtime that shouldn't be done.

```cpp
#include <type_traits>
#include <limits>
#include <stdexcept>

// 核心判断：值 u 赋值给 T 类型的变量，会不会发生 narrowing？
template<typename T, typename U>
constexpr bool would_narrow(U u) noexcept {
    // 第一层：编译期就能排除的情况
    // 如果 T 能表示 U 的所有值，那不管 u 是什么，都不可能 narrowing
    if constexpr (std::is_same_v<T, U>) {
        return false;  // 同类型，废话
    } else if constexpr (std::is_floating_point_v<U> && std::is_integral_v<T>) {
        // 浮点转整数，几乎总是可能 narrowing 的
        // 除非这个浮点数恰好是个整数值且在范围内
        // 这个我们放运行时判断
    } else if constexpr (std::is_floating_point_v<T> && std::is_floating_point_v<U>) {
        // 浮点转浮点，只有当 T 的精度/范围小于 U 时才可能 narrowing
        if constexpr (std::numeric_limits<T>::digits >= std::numeric_limits<U>::digits &&
                      std::numeric_limits<T>::max() >= std::numeric_limits<U>::max() &&
                      std::numeric_limits<T>::lowest() <= std::numeric_limits<U>::lowest()) {
            return false;  // T 的范围和精度都够，编译期直接排除
        }
    } else if constexpr (std::is_integral_v<T> && std::is_integral_v<U>) {
        // 整数转整数的情况最复杂，下面细说
        if constexpr (std::is_signed_v<T> == std::is_signed_v<U>) {
            // 同号比较简单：看范围
            if constexpr (std::numeric_limits<T>::max() >= std::numeric_limits<U>::max() &&
                          std::numeric_limits<T>::lowest() <= std::numeric_limits<U>::lowest()) {
                return false;
            }
        } else if constexpr (std::is_signed_v<T> && std::is_unsigned_v<U>) {
            // signed T 接收 unsigned U
            // T 的正数范围能覆盖 U 的全部值就行
            if constexpr (std::numeric_limits<T>::max() >= std::numeric_limits<U>::max()) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            // unsigned T 接收 signed U
            // U 是负数的话肯定 narrowing，但编译期不知道 u 的值
            // 所以这种情况不能在编译期排除，得放运行时
        }
    }

    // 第二层：编译期排不掉的，运行时判断

    // signed -> unsigned 且源值为负数：一定是 narrowing
    // 注意：不能用 round-trip 检测（int(-1) → unsigned → int(-1) 在补码上是可逆的）
    if constexpr (std::is_unsigned_v<T> && std::is_signed_v<U>) {
        if (u < 0) return true;
    }

    // 先做静态转换，看值有没有变
    T t = static_cast<T>(u);
    if (static_cast<U>(t) != u) {
        return true;  // 转过去再转回来，值不一样，信息丢了
    }

    // 浮点转整数的额外检查：即使转回来一样，也要确认不是那种
    // "3.0 转成 3 再转回 3.0"的巧合——不过这种情况下值确实没丢，
    // 所以其实上面的检查已经够了。但标准对浮点转整数有更严格的要求：
    // 原值必须是整数值（没有小数部分）
    if constexpr (std::is_floating_point_v<U> && std::is_integral_v<T>) {
        // 如果 u 不是整数值，即使 static_cast 恰好截断了，
        // 严格来说也是 narrowing（信息丢失了小数部分）
        if (u != static_cast<U>(static_cast<long long>(u))) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

Looking back at this function, the boundary between how much can be excluded at compile time and how much must be checked at runtime when signed and unsigned are mixed really needs careful thought. There's an easy pitfall: simply using round-trip (convert then convert back) to detect narrowing fails during signed→unsigned conversion—because `int(-1) → unsigned(4294967295) → int(-1)` is completely reversible in two's complement, round-trip can't detect it. So you must explicitly check "is the source value negative" before the round-trip. `if constexpr` plays a key role here—branches that can be determined at compile time won't generate code at all, there won't be a bunch of useless comparison instructions.

## What to do when narrowing occurs? Throw an exception

With the judgment logic in place, the next decision is: how to handle it after detecting narrowing?

The speaker's solution is very direct—throw an exception. After compile-time filtering, the probability of narrowing actually triggering at runtime is extremely low. In most code, types match, excluded at compile time; for those remaining that need runtime checks, the vast majority won't actually overflow. Maybe one in a million calls triggers it, this is exactly the scenario where exceptions excel—handling extremely rare exceptional situations.

```cpp
template<typename T, typename U>
constexpr T narrow_convert(U u) {
    if (would_narrow<T>(u)) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("narrowing conversion detected");
    }
    return static_cast<T>(u);
}
```

It's that simple. You can use it directly:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // 正常情况，不会抛异常
    int a = narrow_convert<int>(42.0);        // OK，42.0 是整数值
    unsigned int b = narrow_convert<unsigned int>(100);  // OK

    // 这些会抛异常
    try {
        char c = narrow_convert<char>(300);   // 300 超出 char 范围
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获到: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    try {
        unsigned int d = narrow_convert<unsigned int>(-1);  // 负数转 unsigned
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获到: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    try {
        int e = narrow_convert<int>(3.14);  // 浮点转整数，有小数部分
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获到: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    std::cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << "\n";
}
```

Run it and see the output:

```text
捕获到: narrowing conversion detected
捕获到: narrowing conversion detected
捕获到: narrowing conversion detected
a = 42, b = 100
```

Great, everything that should be blocked is blocked. But the problem arises—you can't write `narrow_convert<int>(xxx)` at every assignment location. The code becomes verbose, and it's completely impossible to maintain consistency. Relying on programmer self-discipline to add checks, there will definitely be leaks. Some places add them, some forget, and bugs hide in those forgotten places.

## Stuff the check into the type: Number<T>

So the real solution is—make the check implicit. Define a wrapper type `Number<T>`, it automatically does narrowing checks when constructed. After that, this `Number<T>` is used just like a normal `T`, but without worrying about narrowing issues, because if the construction doesn't pass, this object doesn't exist at all.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Number {
    T value_;

public:
    // 构造函数：这里是所有魔法发生的地方
    template<typename U>
    constexpr Number(U u) : value_(narrow_convert<T>(u)) {}

    // 同类型构造不需要检查，但为了统一接口也走一遍（编译期会优化掉）
    constexpr Number(T t) : value_(t) {}

    // 隐式转换回 T，让 Number<T> 能像 T 一样用
    constexpr operator T() const noexcept { return value_; }

    // 取值
    constexpr T get() const noexcept { return value_; }
};
```

You see, this class itself has just that much stuff. It looks like demo code, but it really works. Let's try:

```cpp
int main() {
    // 这些都能正常工作
    Number<int> x = 42;              // int -> int，没问题
    Number<int> y = 3.0;             // double -> int，3.0 是整数值，没问题
    Number<unsigned int> z = 100u;   // unsigned int -> unsigned int，没问题

    // Number<T> 可以当 T 用，因为有了 operator T()
    int sum = x + static_cast<int>(z);  // 正常运算
    std::cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << ", z = " << z << "\n";
    std::cout << "sum = " << sum << "\n";

    // 这些会在构造时抛异常
    try {
        Number<char> c = 300;  // 编译不报错，运行时抛异常
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获到: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    try {
        Number<unsigned int> bad = -1;  // 负数转 unsigned，运行时抛异常
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获到: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```text
x = 42, y = 3, z = 100
sum = 142
捕获到: narrowing conversion detected
捕获到: narrowing conversion detected
```

At this point, we can see a key design idea: previously we thought template metaprogramming and the type system were two different things, but in fact, the type system itself is the best place to do checks. No need to remember where to check and where not to, just use `Number<T>` instead of `T`, and the check happens automatically. And because of the compile-time `if constexpr` branch, those paths that don't need checking (like same-type assignment) won't even generate judgment code, zero overhead.

## But being able to construct isn't enough, it needs to do arithmetic

If a numeric type can only construct but not calculate, what's the difference between it and a constant? So we need to add arithmetic operators to `Number<T>`. But there's a problem here: `Number<int>` plus `Number<double>` should return what? You can't just return a type, you need rules.

There's a thing in the standard library called `std::common_type`, it's exactly for this—given two types, telling you what type to use when doing arithmetic operations on them. For example, `common_type_t<int, double>` is `double`, `common_type_t<int, unsigned int>` is `unsigned int` on most platforms. We use it directly:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

template<typename T>
class Number {
    T value_;

public:
    template<typename U>
    constexpr Number(U u) : value_(narrow_convert<T>(u)) {}
    constexpr Number(T t) : value_(t) {}
    constexpr operator T() const noexcept { return value_; }
    constexpr T get() const noexcept { return value_; }

    // 加法：Number<T> + Number<U> -> Number<common_type_t<T, U>>
    template<typename U>
    constexpr auto operator+(const Number<U>& other) const
        -> Number<std::common_type_t<T, U>>
    {
        using ResultType = std::common_type_t<T, U>;
        // value_ + other.value_ 先做普通算术（会隐式提升），
        // 然后用结果构造 Number<ResultType>，构造时自动做 narrowing 检查
        return Number<ResultType>(value_ + other.get());
    }

    // 减法，同理
    template<typename U>
    constexpr auto operator-(const Number<U>& other) const
        -> Number<std::common_type_t<T, U>>
    {
        using ResultType = std::common_type_t<T, U>;
        return Number<ResultType>(value_ - other.get());
    }

    // 乘法
    template<typename U>
    constexpr auto operator*(const Number<U>& other) const
        -> Number<std::common_type_t<T, U>>
    {
        using ResultType = std::common_type_t<T, U>;
        return Number<ResultType>(value_ * other.get());
    }
};
```

Let's run a slightly more complex example to verify:

```cpp
int main() {
    Number<int> a = 10;
    Number<double> b = 3.5;

    // int + double -> common_type 是 double
    auto result = a + b;
    std::cout << "10 + 3.5 = " << result << "\n";
    std::cout << "结果类型是 Number<double>? "
              << std::is_same_v<decltype(result), Number<double>> << "\n";

    // unsigned + int 的混合运算
    Number<unsigned int> big = 3000000000u;  // 30亿，unsigned int 能表示
    Number<int> small = 100;

    auto result2 = big + small;
    std::cout << "3000000000u + 100 = " << result2 << "\n";

    // 试试溢出场景：两个大数相加
    Number<unsigned int> x = 3000000000u;
    Number<unsigned int> y = 2000000000u;
    try {
        // 3000000000 + 2000000000 = 5000000000，超出 unsigned int 范围
        auto overflow = x + y;
        std::cout << "不应该到这里\n";
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cout << "加法溢出捕获到: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```text
10 + 3.5 = 13.5
结果类型是 Number<double>? 1
3000000000u + 100 = 3000000100
加法溢出捕获到: narrowing conversion detected
```

:::warning Original text error correction: unsigned arithmetic overflow won't be caught by narrow_convert
In the output above, the last line "addition overflow caught" **will not appear** in actual compilation and execution. Actual test result (GCC 16.1.1, C++20):

```text
Raw unsigned sum: 705032704
Would narrow? 0
No exception thrown! overflow = 705032704
```

The reason is: arithmetic for `unsigned int + unsigned int` in C++ is **wrapping** (well-defined wrapping), the result of `3000000000u + 2000000000u` is `705032704`—a legal `unsigned int` value. Subsequently, `narrow_convert<unsigned int>(705032704u)` detects same-type assignment, `would_narrow` directly returns false, and the exception isn't thrown at all.

This is a fundamental limitation of `Number<T>`'s current design: `narrow_convert` can only detect **narrowing conversions during assignment**, it cannot detect **overflow of the arithmetic operation itself**. To detect overflow, you need to use compiler built-ins (like `__builtin_add_overflow`) or manual checks:

```cpp
template<typename T>
constexpr T safe_add(T a, T b) {
    if constexpr (std::is_unsigned_v<T>) {
        if (a > std::numeric_limits<T>::max() - b) {
            throw std::overflow_error("unsigned addition overflow");
        }
    } else {
        // signed overflow is UB, 必须用 __builtin_add_overflow 或类似机制
        T result;
        if (__builtin_add_overflow(a, b, &result)) {
            throw std::overflow_error("signed addition overflow");
        }
        return result;
    }
    return a + b;
}
```

See [01-06-overflow-not-caught.cpp](https://github.com/Awesome-Embedded-Learning-Studio/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/blob/main/code/volumn_codes/vol10/cppcon/2025/01-concept-based-generic-programming/01-06-overflow-not-caught.cpp) for verification code.
:::

Looking at the last overflow capture example—we need to note that `narrow_convert` can only intercept narrowing **during type conversion**, for overflow of the same-type arithmetic operation itself (like wrapping of `unsigned int + unsigned int`), it's powerless. `common_type_t<unsigned int, unsigned int>` is just `unsigned int` itself, the operation result has already wrapped into a legal value before being assigned to `Number<unsigned int>`. To fully defend against arithmetic overflow, additional mechanisms are needed (like compiler built-in overflow check functions), which is beyond `narrow_convert`'s responsibility.

At this point, from manual judgment rules, to runtime check functions, to exception handling strategies, to wrapper types and arithmetic operations, this line is finally connected. The key is to understand these things as a complete narrowing defense system, not isolated knowledge points.

# Don't reinvent the wheel: Function objects in the standard library + eliminating comparison traps

To implement a set of safe integer types, intuitively you have to write addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison operations all by hand, just thinking about it gives you a headache. But actually, the standard library has long prepared `std::plus`, `std::multiplies` and other function objects, each just a few lines of code, not black magic at all. Of course, reinventing the wheel counts as a traditional C++ art.

## First, let's see how to write operators

A common misconception is: to overload `operator+`, `operator*` for custom types, you have to write a bunch of `friend` functions inside or outside the class, handling various boundary conditions in each function. But actually, you just need to use the function objects from the standard library.

```cpp
#include <functional>

// 我定义了一个简化版的 safe_int，只展示核心思路
template <typename T>
struct safe_int {
    T value;

    // 加法：直接用标准库的 std::plus，一行搞定
    friend safe_int operator+(const safe_int& a, const safe_int& b) {
        return safe_int{std::plus<T>{}(a.value, b.value)};
    }

    // 乘法：同理
    friend safe_int operator*(const safe_int& a, const safe_int& b) {
        return safe_int{std::multiplies<T>{}(a.value, b.value)};
    }
};
```

You will find the key here is: `std::plus<T>{}` is a function object, when calling it, if an unintended type conversion happens (like mixing signed and unsigned), it will be blocked by the rules we set up earlier. The operation logic itself doesn't need concern, the standard library has already written it, we just "intercept" and "release".

## Comparison operations: the hardest hit area for signed/unsigned mixing

Operator overloading itself isn't hard, but comparison operations are the hardest hit area for signed/unsigned mixing. Spent a whole afternoon debugging a bug, only to find it was just one wrong comparison line—this isn't uncommon.

Look at this code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = -1;
    unsigned int b = 2;

    std::cout << (a < b) << "\n";  // 你猜输出什么？
}
```

Run it, output is `0`, that is `false`. Negative less than positive, result is actually false? Why? The answer is C++'s implicit conversion rules have a rule—when signed and unsigned are mixed in a comparison, the signed number is converted to unsigned. So `-1` becomes a huge number (`4294967295`), of course it's not less than 2. This rule has existed since C was born in 1972, maybe it seemed fine at the time, but over decades who knows how many bugs it buried.

The speaker said it well: this rule should have been corrected in 1972, but by the time everyone realized how bad it was, there was too much code in the world relying on this behavior, couldn't change it. To this day we are still suffering from it.

## Fix this comparison trap by hand

Since built-in types aren't reliable, let's take over comparison operations in our safe_int. The idea is direct: if the types on both sides differ (one signed one unsigned), do a special judgment first; if types are the same, go straight to normal comparison.

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct safe_int {
    T value;
};

// 跨类型的 operator<：模板化的自由函数，能处理 safe_int<T> 和 safe_int<U> 的比较
template <typename T, typename U>
bool operator<(const safe_int<T>& a, const safe_int<U>& b) {
    if constexpr (std::is_signed_v<T> && std::is_unsigned_v<U>) {
        // a 是有符号，b 是无符号
        // 如果 a 小于零，那它一定小于任何无符号数，直接返回 true
        if (a.value < 0) {
            return true;
        }
        // 否则两边都转成无符号再比，此时 a.value 一定是非负的，转换安全
        return static_cast<std::make_unsigned_t<T>>(a.value) < b.value;
    } else if constexpr (std::is_unsigned_v<T> && std::is_signed_v<U>) {
        // 反过来，a 是无符号，b 是有符号
        if (b.value < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        return a.value < static_cast<std::make_unsigned_t<U>>(b.value);
    } else {
        // 类型一致，正常比较，没有任何转换问题
        return a.value < b.value;
    }
}
```

There is a key point here: `operator<` is written as a **templated free function** rather than a class-internal `friend`. The reason is that the class-internal `friend bool operator<(const safe_int& a, const safe_int& b)` only accepts two `safe_int<T>` with the same T. And `safe_int<int> < safe_int<unsigned int>` is a comparison between two different template instances, the class-internal friend can't match it at all. After writing it as a `template<typename T, typename U>` free function, the compiler can correctly match this operator between `safe_int<int>` and `safe_int<unsigned int>`. `if constexpr` lets the compiler optimize away branches it doesn't take, zero overhead. Equality comparison, greater-than comparison follow the same idea, just write accordingly.

Verify:

```cpp
int main() {
    safe_int<int> a{-1};
    safe_int<unsigned int> b{2};

    std::cout << (a < b) << "\n";  // 输出 1，终于正确了！
    // 注意：a 和 b 是不同模板实例 safe_int<int> 和 safe_int<unsigned int>，
    // 只有模板化的自由 operator< 才能匹配这个调用
}
```


## A bigger pit: range checking silently bypassed

Comparison operations are fixed, but there's a more hidden scenario. The speaker gave a span example—this pattern is very common in actual code.

First, background. `std::span` is essentially a "fat pointer"—a pointer to a sequence of elements plus the length of the sequence. This idea isn't new, Dennis Ritchie proposed adding boundary-carrying pointers to C as early as the early 1990s (for variable-length arrays), called fat pointer then, but the committee felt the runtime overhead was too large and didn't adopt it<RefLink :id="7" preview="Ritchie, Variable-Size Arrays in C, 1990" />. Now C++20 finally added span, it's a vindication decades late—although span itself doesn't do boundary checks, it provides the foundation for upper-level safety wrappers.

Where is the problem? Look at this code:

```cpp
#include <span>
#include <vector>

void process(std::span<int> data) {
    // 我想取 data 的前 max_size - 500 个元素
    unsigned int max_size = 50;  // 本来想写 500，手误写成了 50
    auto sub = data.subspan(0, max_size - 500);
    // sub 现在是什么？
}
```

`max_size` is `unsigned int`, value is 50. What happens to `50 - 500` in unsigned arithmetic? Underflow, becomes a huge number (around `4294967296 - 450`). Then `subspan` gets this huge length—and `std::span::subspan` in C++20 **has no** boundary check, it only has a precondition (violation is undefined behavior), it won't throw exceptions<RefLink :id="6" preview="cppreference, std::span::subspan, C++20" />. This means that huge number is passed directly in, the consequence is undefined behavior—might read memory it shouldn't, might not crash, but you can't count on span to stop it.

Just because of a small typo, just because of built-in type conversion rules, you completely lose the protection of range checking. Many people think span is safe enough, didn't expect it to be bypassed at the parameter calculation layer.

## Use safe_int to give span real protection

Now we have a safe_int that can intercept all wrong conversions, can we make span's size parameter protected too? Of course.

My idea is: first define a concept representing "type that can be spanned", then require in this concept that the size type must be a safe integer.

```cpp
#include <concepts>
#include <span>
#include <vector>

// 先定义我们自己的 safe_int（简化版，假设已经实现了完整的安全运算）
template <typename T>
struct safe_int {
    T value;
    // ... 之前写的所有运算符重载都在这里
};

// 定义一个概念：可 span 的类型
// 标准库里有 std::contiguous_range，我基于它扩展
template <typename T>
concept spanable = std::contiguous_range<T>;

// 现在定义一个安全 span，尺寸类型用 safe_int
template <typename T>
struct safe_span {
    T* data_;
    safe_int<std::size_t> size_;  // 关键：尺寸是安全整数

    // 构造函数，从普通容器构造
    template <spanable Container>
    explicit safe_span(Container& c)
        : data_(c.data())
        , size_(safe_int<std::size_t>{c.size()})
    {}

    // 安全的 subspan
    safe_span subspan(std::size_t offset, safe_int<std::size_t> count) {
        // count 是 safe_int，任何溢出运算都会在构造阶段就被拦住
        // 不可能再出现 "50 - 500 变成巨大数" 的情况
        return safe_span{data_ + offset, count};
    }

    T* data() const { return data_; }
    std::size_t size() const { return size_.value; }
};
```

The key point is that the member variable `size_` is of type `safe_int<std::size_t>` not the bare `std::size_t`. This means any operation on this size—subtraction, comparison, assignment—will go through our safety check. If someone writes `50 - 500`, safe_int will report an error the moment the operation happens, rather than letting a huge number quietly slip into subspan. **We don't need to remedy this in span's boundary check, we need to eliminate the generation of wrong values from the source—integer operations themselves.** Looking back, the idea is actually simple: replace unsafe built-in integers with safe wrapper types, let errors be caught the moment they happen, rather than waiting for them to propagate to some boundary check to be discovered. In other words—let the class that should really be responsible handle the corresponding error, don't let other components cover for you.

# Add boundary checks to span: from manual defense to type deduction

The problem of array out-of-bounds has always been a headache: it runs fast, but once it goes out of bounds, the program might crash in a completely unrelated place, and then you stare at gdb for half an hour. Next, let's look at a structured way to check subscript out-of-bounds.

## First, clarify what we want to do

The core requirement is actually very simple: I have a contiguous memory area, I know how big it is, I want to automatically check if the subscript is out of bounds every time I access it with a subscript. If it's out of bounds, throw an exception immediately or be blocked by the compiler, rather than waiting for memory to be corrupted before I find out.

Doesn't this sound like what `std::vector`'s `at()` does? But the difference is, I don't want to bear the cost of a dynamically allocated vector, I might just have a bare pointer plus a length, or a native array, and I want to access it in the same safe way. This is the meaning of span—it doesn't own the data, it just "looks" at the data, but when looking, it can help watch the boundaries.

## Write a checked subscript access by hand

Let's start with the most basic scenario. Suppose I already have a span-like thing, it holds data and size internally. What I need to do now is overload `operator[]` to make it do a range check before executing the access.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <span>
#include <array>

// 一个简单的带边界检查的 span 包装
template<typename T>
class checked_span {
    T* ptr_;
    std::size_t size_;

public:
    // 用指针和大小初始化——这就是"spanable"的本质
    checked_span(T* ptr, std::size_t size) : ptr_(ptr), size_(size) {}

    // 带检查的下标访问
    T& operator[](std::size_t index) {
        if (index >= size_) {
            throw std::out_of_range("下标越界了兄弟");
        }
        return ptr_[index];
    }

    const T& operator[](std::size_t index) const {
        if (index >= size_) {
            throw std::out_of_range("下标越界了兄弟");
        }
        return ptr_[index];
    }

    std::size_t size() const { return size_; }
};
```

You see, the constructor here only accepts a pointer and a size, this is so-called "spanable"—anything that can provide a data pointer and element count can be used to initialize it. Then `operator[]` does one thing: if the index you give is greater than or equal to size, throw an exception directly.

## Run it and see the effect

```cpp
int main() {
    int data[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    checked_span<int> s(data, 5);

    // 正常访问，没问题
    std::cout << s[2] << "\n";  // 输出 3

    // 越界访问，抛异常
    try {
        std::cout << s[10] << "\n";
    } catch (const std::out_of_range& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获到异常: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Running it, the output is like this:

```text
3
捕获到异常: 下标越界了兄弟
```

At this point, you might think, this isn't special, `std::vector::at()` is just like this. Don't worry, the key point is later.

## The problem of negative subscripts—the pit of signed and unsigned

There is an easily overlooked trap here. `operator[]` accepts a parameter of type `std::size_t`, this is an unsigned integer. If you pass a `-10` directly, what happens?

```cpp
// 你以为你在传 -10，其实编译器会做隐式转换
// -10 作为无符号整数会变成一个巨大的正数
// s[-10] 实际上变成了 s[18446744073709551606] 之类的鬼东西
```

But! If you change the parameter type to signed `ptrdiff_t`, then the compiler can help you block some obvious problems at compile time. Or, if you use the standard implementation of `std::span`, it has specific requirements for the subscript type.

Let me change the writing, make the subscript type signed, so negative numbers can be correctly identified:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class checked_span_v2 {
    T* ptr_;
    std::size_t size_;

public:
    checked_span_v2(T* ptr, std::size_t size) : ptr_(ptr), size_(size) {}

    // 注意这里用 ptrdiff_t（有符号）而不是 size_t（无符号）
    T& operator[](std::ptrdiff_t index) {
        // 先检查负数
        if (index < 0) {
            throw std::out_of_range("负数下标，你想干嘛");
        }
        // 再检查上界
        if (static_cast<std::size_t>(index) >= size_) {
            throw std::out_of_range("下标越界了兄弟");
        }
        return ptr_[index];
    }

    std::size_t size() const { return size_; }
};
```

```cpp
int main() {
    int data[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    checked_span_v2<int> s(data, 5);

    try {
        auto val = s[-10];  // 现在能正确捕获负数下标了
        std::cout << val << "\n";
    } catch (const std::out_of_range& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获到异常: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text
捕获到异常: 负数下标，你想干嘛
```

It's worth noting here that when using `size_t` as the subscript type, a negative number passed in is directly implicitly converted to an astronomical number, then either it just happens to not go out of bounds and reads garbage data (more scary), or it goes out of bounds and throws an exception but the error message is completely misleading. After changing to `ptrdiff_t`, a negative number is a negative number, clear and clear.

However, the compiler can only block the simplest cases like literal negative numbers. In actual projects, the real problems are often values calculated elsewhere—some function returns a -1 to indicate failure, forgetting to check and using it directly as a subscript. This can only be caught at runtime, but at least with this check, the program won't silently corrupt memory.

## Using another span's element as size—a more realistic scenario

The speaker mentioned a very practical example: you use a value from one span as the size parameter for another operation. You don't actually know what that value is, but unless it's a reasonable positive integer, it should be blocked.

```cpp
void process_with_dynamic_size(std::span<double> params, std::span<double> data) {
    // params[0] 里存的是我们想要处理的元素个数
    // 但我们不知道它到底是多少，可能是 5，可能是 -3，可能是 100000
    double count_raw = params[0];

    // 把它转成整数之前，先做检查
    if (count_raw < 0 || count_raw != static_cast<double>(static_cast<std::size_t>(count_raw))) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("params[0] 不是合法的正整数");
    }

    std::size_t count = static_cast<std::size_t>(count_raw);
    if (count > data.size()) {
        throw std::out_of_range("请求的元素个数超过了数据范围");
    }

    // 安全地处理前 count 个元素
    double sum = 0;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        sum += data[i];
    }
    std::cout << "前 " << count << " 个元素的和: " << sum << "\n";
}
```

```cpp
int main() {
    double params_good[] = {3.0};
    double params_bad[] = {-5.0};
    double data[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};

    // 正常情况
    process_with_dynamic_size(params_good, data);

    // 异常情况
    try {
        process_with_dynamic_size(params_bad, data);
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获到异常: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text
前 3 个元素的和: 6
捕获到异常: params[0] 不是合法的正整数
```

This kind of writing is particularly common in real projects. You get a number from a config file, network protocol, user input, and then use it to decide how many elements to access. Without checking, this is a perfect security vulnerability.

## Type deduction: stop repeating what the compiler already knows

At this point, every time you have to write `checked_span<int>`, `checked_span<double>` repeating the element type, while the compiler can deduce it from the initialization parameters. This is the problem that C++17's CTAD (Class Template Argument Deduction) was introduced to solve. Just add a deduction guide:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class checked_span_v3 {
    T* ptr_;
    std::size_t size_;

public:
    checked_span_v3(T* ptr, std::size_t size) : ptr_(ptr), size_(size) {}

    T& operator[](std::ptrdiff_t index) {
        if (index < 0 || static_cast<std::size_t>(index) >= size_) {
            throw std::out_of_range("下标越界");
        }
        return ptr_[index];
    }

    const T& operator[](std::ptrdiff_t index) const {
        if (index < 0 || static_cast<std::size_t>(index) >= size_) {
            throw std::out_of_range("下标越界");
        }
        return ptr_[index];
    }

    std::size_t size() const { return size_; }
};

// 推导指引：只要看到 (指针, 大小) 的组合，自动推导元素类型
template<typename T>
checked_span_v3(T*, std::size_t) -> checked_span_v3<T>;
```

Now writing it is much cleaner:

```cpp
int main() {
    int aa[100] = {};

    // 以前要这么写：checked_span_v3<int> s(aa, 100);
    // 现在编译器自己推断，aa 是 int*，所以 s 就是 checked_span_v3<int>
    // 这样，我们可以少写很多代码
    checked_span_v3 s(aa, 100);

    // 编译器非常清楚 s 是 checked_span_v3<int>，有 100 个元素
    // 我不需要再重复一遍 int 和 100
    s[0] = 42;
    std::cout << s[0] << "\n";  // 42

    // 配合 range-based for 循环，现代 C++ 的常规操作
    // 比以前写 for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) 舒服太多了
    std::size_t count = 0;
    for (auto& val : aa) {
        if (val != 0) ++count;
    }
    std::cout << "非零元素个数: " << count << "\n";  // 1

    return 0;
}
```

Type deduction seems like "syntactic sugar", but after writing hundreds of span-related codes in a project, you'll find that writing one less `int` isn't about saving three characters, it's that when you change `int` to `int64_t` later, you only need to change one place, not look all over the world for where you missed writing.

This is a core philosophy of generic programming: don't repeat what the compiler already knows and you already know.

## Subspan and construction from pointers—a more complete toolbox

Just having a complete span isn't enough. In actual development, you often need to cut a small piece from a large span, or construct a span from a bare pointer.

First, the scenario of constructing from a pointer. Since the meaning of span is safety, isn't constructing a span from a bare pointer inherently Unsafe? There's indeed no way to check whether that pointer really points to that many elements—the compiler doesn't know, and runtime can't verify it either. But the key is: **constructing a span from a pointer itself appears extremely abrupt in code reviews and static analysis tools**. If a project specification requires "all array access must go through span", then writing `span(ptr, n)` code, the reviewer can see at a glance: here is an unsafe boundary, needs focus. This is much easier to manage than having `ptr[i]` everywhere.

```cpp
#include <span>

// 从指针构造 span 的辅助函数
// 故意写成函数形式，让它在代码审查中更显眼
template<typename T>
std::span<T> make_span_from_ptr(T* ptr, std::size_t size) {
    return std::span<T>(ptr, size);
}

// 取前 n 个元素的子 span
template<typename T>
std::span<T> take_front(std::span<T> s, std::size_t n) {
    if (n > s.size()) {
        throw std::out_of_range("take_front: n 超过了 span 的大小");
    }
    return s.subspan(0, n);
}

// 取某个范围内的子 span
template<typename T>
std::span<T> take_range(std::span<T> s, std::size_t offset, std::size_t count) {
    if (offset > s.size() || count > s.size() - offset) {
        throw std::out_of_range("take_range: 范围超出");
    }
    return s.subspan(offset, count);
}
```

```cpp
int main() {
    int data[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100};

    // 从指针构造——代码审查时这行会特别显眼
    auto full = make_span_from_ptr(data, 10);

    // 取前 3 个
    auto front3 = take_front(full, 3);
    std::cout << "前3个: ";
    for (auto v : front3) std::cout << v << " ";
    std::cout << "\n";

    // 取下标 2 到 5 的范围（3 个元素）
    auto mid = take_range(full, 2, 3);
    std::cout << "中间3个: ";
    for (auto v : mid) std::cout << v << " ";
    std::cout << "\n";

    // 越界测试
    try {
        auto bad = take_front(full, 20);
    } catch (const std::out_of_range& e) {
        std::cout << "捕获: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text
前3个: 10 20 30
中间3个: 30 40 50
捕获: take_front: n 超过了 span 的大小
```

Note the way I write the boundary check in `take_range`: `count > s.size() - offset`. I didn't use `offset + count > s.size()` here because the latter might overflow when signed and unsigned are mixed. Although in this scenario `offset` and `count` are both `size_t` and won't overflow, developing the habit of using subtraction rather than addition for range checks can save you from pitfalls in other places. This is also the idea mentioned in the speech of "using numbers rather than mixing signed and unsigned".

Similarly, these helper functions can also add deduction guides, so the call site doesn't need to write template parameters. Two lines of deduction guides, but the code reads completely differently—you see `take_front(full, 3)`, not `take_front<int>(full, 3)`. The compiler knows `full` is `span<int>`, it can deduce the return value is also `span<int>`, you don't need to worry about it.

At this point, span's basic safe access, type deduction, and subspan slicing are all sorted. The code looks quite clean, no redundant repetition, checks are done where they should be. But things aren't over—there are more complex scenarios later.

# From Loops to Iterators: The Path to Abstracting Data Traversal

:::tip
This article is based on a deep dive into CppCon 2025: Mike Shah's "Back to Basics: C++ Ranges". The YouTube link is above. This series is planned to be split into three parts: this part clarifies the thread of "traversing data" (loops → pointers → iterators → range-based for); the second part covers STL algorithms and iterator pitfalls; the third part officially enters Ranges, Views, and pipeline composition. The experimental environment is Arch Linux WSL, GCC 16.1.1, compiler flag `-std=c++20`.
:::

Mike Shah opened his talk with a simple statement that makes more and more sense the more I think about it: **an algorithm is essentially a loop**. He mentioned reading a 2012 paper on empirical algorithm performance evaluation during his graduate studies, which gave him this inspiration: when facing an unfamiliar codebase and wanting to figure out "where the computation actually happens," the fastest way is to look for the loops. Because as engineers, half of our job is **transforming data**, and the other half is **storing data**, and loops are the most direct vehicle for "transforming data."

:::warning Take Shah's statement with a grain of salt
"Algorithm = Loop" is a "gross oversimplification" that he repeatedly emphasized, so just get the gist. Strictly speaking, an algorithm is a finite sequence of steps to solve a problem—recursive algorithms, parallel algorithms (`<execution>`), and coroutine-based algorithms don't necessarily take the form of `for`. Loops are just one of the most common carriers. But as an entry point to understanding STL and Ranges, this simplification is useful: **understand loops first, then see how STL abstracts them away.**
:::

In this article, we will start with the most primitive index loop and see step-by-step how C++ abstracts "traversing data" layer by layer. Our destination is not Ranges (that's part three), but **iterators**—the bridge connecting "loops" and "algorithms."

Let's lay out the experimental environment first; all subsequent outputs are based on it:

```bash
❯ g++ --version
g++ (GCC) 16.1.1 20260430

❯ uname -sr
Linux 6.18.33.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2
```

## The Most Primitive Traversal: Indexed `for` Loop

Everything starts here. Suppose we have a string of characters to print one by one. Most people subconsciously write the three-part `for`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main()
{
    std::array<char, 5> message{'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};

    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < message.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << message[i];
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
}
```

This code actually hides two implicit assumptions that we use so smoothly we don't think about them. First, it assumes the container supports `operator[]` index access; second, it assumes the container knows its own `size()`. `std::array`, `std::vector`, and `std::string` all satisfy these, so it runs fine. But switch to `std::list` or `std::set`—which don't have index access—and this code won't compile. The same "traversal" logic requires rewriting when the container changes, which is a signal of insufficient abstraction.

But let's not rush to abstract. Whether indexed loops should be used and when is a nuanced issue, but it's not the focus here. What we care about is: **it expresses "traversal," but it binds traversal to "the container happens to be contiguous storage and happens to support indexing."** We want to extract the former separately.

## A Different Perspective: Traversing with Pointers

Shah switched to a different style on the slide, and I paused for a moment—this actually works? He doesn't use indices but gets the address of the first element of the array and walks with pointers:

```cpp
char* begin = message.data();
char* end   = message.data() + message.size();
for (char* p = begin; p != end; ++p) {
    std::cout << *p;
}
```

Here, `data()` returns the address of the first element of the underlying array, and `end` is the first address plus the number of elements—pointer arithmetic. Then inside the loop, `*p` dereferences and `++p` advances one step. The result is identical to the indexed version, but the perspective is completely different: **we no longer rely on the "index" abstraction, but directly manipulate "addresses."**

Why switch perspectives? Shah's motivation is direct—**generalization**. Indexing assumes "contiguous storage + random access," but in reality, many data structures are not contiguous: linked lists, trees, graphs. How do you `tree[i]` a binary tree? You can't use an integer to index it. But "starting from a certain point and walking to the next element step by step" is the common core of all data structure traversals. Pointer `++` is just the simplest implementation of "go to next."

:::tip By the way, the origin of STL
Abstracting "incrementing a pointer" into a replaceable object was the work done by Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee at HP Labs in the 90s—this is the prototype of STL, submitted to the committee in 1993-94, and later merged into the C++98 standard. Iterators were born from the start to "decouple algorithms from data structures," not added as an afterthought.
:::

## Iterators: Generalization of Pointers

Since "going to the next element" can have different implementations, let's abstract it into a type—this is an **iterator**. The first sentence on cppreference for iterators is: **"Iterators are a generalization of pointers"**<RefLink :id="1" preview="cppreference, Iterator library — iterators are a generalization of pointers" />.

We use the `std::begin` and `std::end` free functions to get the iterators for the beginning and end of the container:

```cpp
for (auto it = std::begin(message); it != std::end(message); ++it) {
    std::cout << *it;
}
```

You see, the writing is almost identical to the pointer version—`begin`, `end`, `!=`, `++`, `*`. The only difference is that the type of `it` is no longer `char*`, but an object that "behaves like a pointer." Switch to `std::list` or `std::set`, and this code runs without changing a word (as long as their iterators support these operations). Abstraction starts to pay off here.

There are two details worth stopping for. First, `begin()` points to the first element, while `end()` points to **one past the last element** (one-past-the-end), and it itself cannot be dereferenced. This convention of the half-open range `[begin, end)` wasn't chosen arbitrarily: **it makes the judgment of an "empty container" extremely natural**—an empty container is just `begin == end`, the loop condition is directly false, and no special case is needed. If `end` pointed to the last element itself, then an empty container would have no "last element," making handling awkward.

The second detail is the difference between these **free function** forms, `std::begin` / `std::end`, and the container's **member function** forms, `.begin()` / `.end()`.

:::warning Shah wasn't quite accurate here
Shah said in the talk, "Only some containers have `.begin()`, `.end()`, but not all containers have them, so free functions are more general"—this statement is actually **inaccurate**. The fact is: **all STL containers have `.begin()` / `.end()` member functions**, without exception.

The true value of the free functions `std::begin` / `std::end` lies in three things: first, they are overloaded for **raw arrays** (like `int arr[5]`)—arrays have no member functions, so you must rely on free functions to get the beginning and end pointers; second, they make **generic code** more uniform to write (no need to distinguish between "container or array" in templates); third, C++20's `std::ranges::begin` can also handle sentinels and proxy types (like `vector<bool>`). So a more accurate statement is: **free functions are more uniform for built-in arrays and custom types, not "some containers lack member functions."**
:::

## Iterator Category System: Not All Iterators Are Created Equal

At this step, Shah in the talk directly said, "I won't go into the details of iterator categories," and skipped it. But this is exactly where beginners are most likely to trip, so since this article is a deep dive, we'll fill it in—this is the **highlight** of this part.

Not all iterators have the same capabilities. `std::vector`'s iterator can `it + 5` jump five steps at once, but `std::list`'s iterator cannot; it can only `++` walk step by step. The standard divides iterators into several **categories** by capability, from weak to strong: Input → Forward → Bidirectional → Random Access → Contiguous (added in C++20).

The key question is: **how do you know which category a given iterator belongs to?** Before C++20, it relied on a type trait called `std::iterator_traits<T>::iterator_category` (a tag type); after C++20, it changed to a set of **concepts**, such as `std::random_access_iterator<T>` and `std::contiguous_iterator<T>`. These two systems coexist in C++20, but they may give **different** answers for the same iterator—this hides a very important evolution.

I wrote a small program using GCC 16.1.1 to print both sets of results for common containers:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <deque>
#include <list>
#include <forward_list>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <iterator>
#include <type_traits>
#include <cstdio>

// 旧的 C++98 风格：从 iterator_traits 取 tag
template<class Iter>
const char* legacy_tag()
{
    using cat = typename std::iterator_traits<Iter>::iterator_category;
    if constexpr (std::is_same_v<cat, std::contiguous_iterator_tag>) return "contiguous";
    else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<cat, std::random_access_iterator_tag>) return "random_access";
    else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<cat, std::bidirectional_iterator_tag>) return "bidirectional";
    else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<cat, std::forward_iterator_tag>) return "forward";
    else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<cat, std::input_iterator_tag>) return "input";
    else return "?";
}

// 新的 C++20 风格：用 concept 探测
template<class Iter>
const char* cpp20_concept()
{
    if constexpr (std::contiguous_iterator<Iter>) return "contiguous_iterator";
    else if constexpr (std::random_access_iterator<Iter>) return "random_access_iterator";
    else if constexpr (std::bidirectional_iterator<Iter>) return "bidirectional_iterator";
    else if constexpr (std::forward_iterator<Iter>) return "forward_iterator";
    else if constexpr (std::input_iterator<Iter>) return "input_iterator";
    else return "(none)";
}

template<class Iter>
void row(const char* name)
{
    std::printf("%-26s legacy_category=%-15s cpp20_concept=%s\n",
                name, legacy_tag<Iter>(), cpp20_concept<Iter>());
}

int main()
{
    row<std::array<int, 5>::iterator>("std::array<int,5>");
    row<std::vector<int>::iterator>("std::vector<int>");
    row<std::string::iterator>("std::string");
    row<std::deque<int>::iterator>("std::deque<int>");
    row<std::list<int>::iterator>("std::list<int>");
    row<std::forward_list<int>::iterator>("std::forward_list<int>");
    row<std::set<int>::iterator>("std::set<int>");
    row<std::map<int, int>::iterator>("std::map<int,int>");
    row<int*>("int* (raw pointer)");

    static_assert(std::contiguous_iterator<int*>);
    static_assert(std::random_access_iterator<std::vector<int>::iterator>);
    static_assert(!std::contiguous_iterator<std::deque<int>::iterator>);
    static_assert(!std::random_access_iterator<std::list<int>::iterator>);
    std::printf("static_assert checks: PASS\n");
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
❯ g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall iter.cpp -o iter && ./iter
std::array<int,5>          legacy_category=random_access   cpp20_concept=contiguous_iterator
std::vector<int>           legacy_category=random_access   cpp20_concept=contiguous_iterator
std::string                legacy_category=random_access   cpp20_concept=contiguous_iterator
std::deque<int>            legacy_category=random_access   cpp20_concept=random_access_iterator
std::list<int>             legacy_category=bidirectional   cpp20_concept=bidirectional_iterator
std::forward_list<int>     legacy_category=forward         cpp20_concept=forward_iterator
std::set<int>              legacy_category=bidirectional   cpp20_concept=bidirectional_iterator
std::map<int,int>          legacy_category=bidirectional   cpp20_concept=bidirectional_iterator
int* (raw pointer)         legacy_category=random_access   cpp20_concept=contiguous_iterator
static_assert checks: PASS
```

See the pattern? **The most interesting parts are the first few lines and the last line.** `std::array`, `std::vector`, `std::string`, and raw pointers `int*`—their old tags are all `random_access`, but C++20 concepts detect them as `contiguous_iterator`.

This is the problem: **in the old tag system, there is no `contiguous` (contiguous) level at all** (`contiguous_iterator_tag` was only added in C++20). Before C++20, `int*`'s `iterator_category` could only be marked as `random_access`, unable to express the stronger property that "this memory is not only randomly accessible but also physically contiguous." Why is this distinction important? Because "contiguous storage" means you can safely treat the underlying data of the iterator as a block of contiguous memory and feed it to a C interface (like `memcpy`, CUDA kernels, or SIMD instructions)—while `std::deque` also supports `it + 5`, its internal storage is chunked, **not contiguous**, so its concept is `random_access_iterator` rather than `contiguous`.

:::tip This is where concepts beat tags
Old tags are an inheritance chain (`random_access_iterator_tag` inherits from `bidirectional_iterator_tag` inherits from...), with limited expressive power, only able to layer. C++20 concepts are a set of **orthogonal, composable constraints** that can precisely state that "random access" and "contiguous storage" are two things that can exist independently. This is also why the entire Ranges system had to wait for C++20 concepts to land before entering the standard—without concepts, many constraints simply cannot be expressed. For a more systematic explanation of concepts, you can check the relevant articles in vol4; we will also use them in part three when discussing Ranges.
:::

## Iterator Arithmetic and `std::advance`

With the concept of categories, let's look at iterator arithmetic operations again. For random access iterators, you can directly `it + 5`, `it - 2`, and `it1 - it2` (calculate distance), all of which are O(1). But for bidirectional or forward iterators, `it + 5` simply won't compile—they only recognize `++` and `--`.

So if I'm writing generic code and want to "move forward n steps" but don't want to limit the iterator category, what do I do? The standard library provides `std::advance`<RefLink :id="2" preview="cppreference, std::advance — advances an iterator by n positions" />:

```cpp
auto it   = std::begin(message);
auto last = std::end(message);
std::ptrdiff_t available = std::distance(it, last);
if (5 < available) {
    std::advance(it, 5);   // 安全：确认走得到
}
```

The beauty of `std::advance` is that it **automatically selects the implementation** based on the iterator category: pass it `vector::iterator`, it takes `it + n` (O(1)); pass it `list::iterator`, it degrades to n times `++` (O(n)). The same call interface, different algorithmic complexity behind the scenes—this is the sweetness of generic programming.

:::warning advance does not check bounds
But one thing must be reminded: **`std::advance` does not check bounds itself**. If you ask it to move forward 100 steps and there are only 5 elements in the container, it won't error but will go out of bounds—dereferencing is a segmentation fault (UB). That's why in the code above, I first used `std::distance` to calculate the remaining length and made a judgment. In actual combat, if you want iterators with bounds checking, GCC/Clang can add the `-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG` compile macro to make standard library iterators carry bounds detection in debug mode—we'll use this in the next part to catch a real out-of-bounds bug. On the MSVC side, the corresponding flag is `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=2`.
:::

## Range-based `for`: Syntactic Sugar for Loops

After talking about iterators for so long, let's return to daily coding—we rarely hand-write `for (auto it = begin; it != end; ++it)` but use the **range-based for loop** given by C++11:

```cpp
for (char c : message) {
    std::cout << c;
}
```

Clean, hard to get wrong, no need to worry about `end`. But what is behind this syntactic sugar? Actually, it's the equivalent rewrite of the hand-written iterator loop above. According to the standard<RefLink :id="3" preview="cppreference, Range-based for loop — equivalent expansion" />, it is roughly equivalent to:

```cpp
{
    auto&& __range = message;
    auto  __begin  = std::begin(__range);   // 或 __range.begin()
    auto  __end    = std::end(__range);     // 或 __range.end()
    for (; __begin != __end; ++__begin) {
        char c = *__begin;
        std::cout << c;                      // 你的循环体
    }
}
```

This explains a common confusion: **how does range-based for know to call `begin`/`end`?** The answer is the compiler helps you insert these two sentences behind the scenes. It first gets `__range`, then takes the beginning and end iterators, and then it's just a normal iterator loop. So range-based for has no additional requirements for iterator categories—as long as your type can provide `begin`/`end` (member or free functions both work), it can be used. This is also why later we can directly plug custom types into range-based for as long as they implement these two functions.

If traversing a key-value container like `std::map`, C++17's **structured binding** combined with range-based for is very handy:

```cpp
const std::map<std::string, int> scores{
    {"alice", 90}, {"bob", 85}
};

for (const auto& [name, score] : scores) {
    std::cout << name << ": " << score << '\n';
}
```

:::warning Add a version number for structured binding
Shah used structured binding in the talk, but **didn't mark which standard feature it is**—let's add that here: **structured binding was introduced in C++17 (proposal P0217)**<RefLink :id="4" preview="cppreference, Structured binding declaration (since C++17)" />. If your project is still on C++14, this code won't compile.

Also, Shah mentioned "ellipsis syntax can further unpack," which is actually a bit vague. Structured binding itself doesn't support variadic unpacking (the number of elements it binds is fixed and must match the number of members of the type on the right); ellipsis in C++ belongs to the context of template parameter pack expansion and fold expressions, which is not the same thing as structured binding. It's recommended to treat this as a slip of the tongue and not delve too deep.
:::

## Experiment: Do `range-based for` and Hand-written Loops Compile the Same?

Every time I tell people "range-based for is just syntactic sugar," some are skeptical—won't those `__range`, `__begin`, and `__end` temporary variables slow down performance? Let's test. I wrote the same "summation" in four ways:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int sum_index(const std::vector<int>& v)
{
    int s = 0;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) s += v[i];
    return s;
}

int sum_ptr(const std::vector<int>& v)
{
    int s = 0;
    for (const int* p = v.data(), *e = p + v.size(); p != e; ++p) s += *p;
    return s;
}

int sum_iter(const std::vector<int>& v)
{
    int s = 0;
    for (auto it = v.begin(), e = v.end(); it != e; ++it) s += *it;
    return s;
}

int sum_rangefor(const std::vector<int>& v)
{
    int s = 0;
    for (int x : v) s += x;
    return s;
}
```

Then turn on `-O2` to let the compiler generate assembly:

```bash
❯ g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -S codegen.cpp -o codegen.s
```

Go to the `.s` file and look for the hot loops of these four functions, and you will find they uniformly look like this (taking `sum_rangefor` as an example):

```asm
.L19:
    addl    (%rax), %edx      ; s += *p
    addq    $4, %rax          ; p++  (int 占 4 字节)
    cmpq    %rcx, %rax        ; p == e ?
    jne     .L19              ; 不等就继续
```

The loop bodies generated by the four writing methods are **byte-level almost identical**—the compiler, under `-O2`, reduces all those temporary variables, index calculations, and pointer arithmetic to the same `add / cmp / jne`. This means that **range-based for has no additional overhead once optimization is enabled**, so you can use it freely for readability. The cost only appears at `-O0` (no optimization): those `__begin`/`__end` temporals will honestly exist on the stack, but who pursues performance under `-O0`?

:::tip A small pit fixed in C++17
By the way, a bit of history about range-based for itself: it entered the standard in C++11 (proposal N2930). But the C++11 version of the expansion rule had a flaw—it would re-evaluate `__end` every loop (or the caching strategy for `.end()` was unfriendly to some proxy types). C++17 (proposal P0184) specifically fixed this, making `__end` evaluated only once at the start of the loop. So the range-based for you use today is the C++17 revised version, more stable. This also reminds us: use the new standard whenever possible; many "syntactic sugars" have been quietly polished in subsequent versions.
:::

## A Pair of Iterators Is a Range

Here we can draw a complete line for "traversal": **a start iterator `begin`, plus an end marker `end`, walking step by step with `++` in between**—this pair of iterators defines a traversable piece of data. The standard library calls this "pair of iterators" a **range**<RefLink :id="5" preview="cppreference, Ranges library — a range is defined by begin and end" />.

Why is this concept important? Because it completely decouples "where the data is" from "how to process the data." If I write a summation function that can receive a pair of iterators, it applies to `vector`, `list`, `set`, and even a hand-written linked list—as long as those containers can provide compliant iterators. Algorithms are no longer bound to a specific container.

And the iterator abstraction itself is actually a classic design pattern—**Iterator pattern**, belonging to the behavioral patterns in GoF's *Design Patterns*. Its core idea is to "provide a method to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its internal representation." C++ makes it a language-level facility (the convention of `begin`/`end`/`operator++`/`operator*`), so any type that follows this convention can plug into the entire STL algorithm ecosystem.

This definition of "a pair of iterators is a range" is the predecessor of the `std::ranges::range` concept we will discuss in part three. The difference is that C++20's range concept allows `end` to return a **sentinel of a different type than `begin`**—this unlocks some interesting capabilities (for example, when traversing a C string ending in `'\0'`, you don't need to calculate the length first). We'll leave this for part three.

## What Have We Clarified Here

Starting from the most primitive indexed `for`, we saw how "traversal" was abstracted step by step: the indexed loop bound traversal to "contiguous storage + random access"; pointer traversal liberated it to the "address" level; iterators abstracted it further into "an object that can `++` and can `*`," decoupling algorithms from data structures. We also filled in the iterator category system that Shah skipped, and used GCC 16.1.1 to empirically verify a key fact: **old tags broadly mark `vector`/`string`/raw pointers as `random_access`, while C++20 concepts can precisely state they are actually stronger `contiguous_iterator`**—this is exactly why concepts are better than tags, and why Ranges had to wait for C++20 to land.

The core is one sentence: **a pair of iterators (one `begin`, one `end`) defines a range, and STL algorithms are built on this pair of iterators.**

In the next part, we will hand this pair of iterators to STL algorithms—see how `std::sort`, `std::partition`, `std::transform`, these "loop substitutes," are used, and what hard requirements they have for iterator categories (e.g., why `std::sort` cannot be used on `std::list`). There are also classic iterator traps waiting for us: iterator invalidation, mismatched `begin`/`end`, reversed parameter order. If you want to review the memory layout of containers first, vol3's [span: A View That Doesn't Own Data](../../../../vol3-standard-library/02-span.md) and container-related articles are good前置阅读.

# Part 29: Constraining Callbacks with Concepts + Full Code Walkthrough

> Continuing from the previous part: we have the skeleton of the `Button` template class in place. In this part, we tackle the final C++ feature—using concepts to constrain the callback parameter types—and then do a complete walkthrough of the entire `main.cpp` call chain from start to finish.

---

## The Callback Type Problem

`poll_events()` accepts a callback function as a parameter, invoking it whenever a confirmed button state change occurs. The problem is that the C++ template parameter `Callback` can be any type—a function pointer, a lambda, a function object, or even an integer (if you make a coding mistake).

Without concepts, what happens if we pass a callback with the wrong signature?

```cpp
// 错误的回调：接受 int 而不是 ButtonEvent
button.poll_events([](int x) { /* ... */ }, HAL_GetTick());
```

The compiler attempts to instantiate the code for `poll_events()`, discovers that `int` cannot be constructed from `Pressed` when calling `cb(Pressed{})`, and then reports an error. But the error message might look like this:

```text
error: no match for call to '(lambda) (Pressed)'
note: candidate expects 1 argument of type 'int', got 'Pressed'
  in instantiation of 'void Button::poll_events(Callback&&, uint32_t, uint32_t)
    [with Callback = main()::<lambda(int)>; ...]'
```

A few lines of template instantiation stack trace paired with obscure type information. While this is much better than the SFINAE errors of C++98, it still isn't intuitive enough.

---

## Concepts: One-Line Constraint, Clear Errors

```cpp
template <typename Callback>
    requires std::invocable<Callback, ButtonEvent>
void poll_events(Callback&& cb, uint32_t now_ms, uint32_t debounce_ms = 20) {
```

`requires std::invocable<Callback, ButtonEvent>` is a concepts constraint. It tells the compiler: an object of type `Callback` must be callable with a single `ButtonEvent` argument.

If we pass a callback with the wrong signature:

```cpp
button.poll_events([](int x) { /* ... */ }, HAL_GetTick());
```

The compiler reports the error **before template instantiation**:

```text
error: constraint 'std::invocable<lambda, ButtonEvent>' not satisfied
note: the expression 'std::invocable<lambda, ButtonEvent>' evaluated to 'false'
```

One sentence says it all: your callback does not satisfy the `std::invocable<Callback, ButtonEvent>` constraint. There is no need to dig through template instantiation stacks—a constraint failure directly points out the problem.

### What Does std::invocable Mean?

`std::invocable<F, Args...>` is a concept defined in the C++20 `<concepts>` header. It checks whether, given an object `f` of type `F`, the expression `f(args...)` is a valid call expression.

For `std::invocable<Callback, ButtonEvent>`:

- `Callback` is the lambda or function object you pass in
- `ButtonEvent` is `std::variant<Pressed, Released>`
- The constraint requires: `cb(ButtonEvent{})` must be a valid call

Examples of valid callbacks:

```cpp
// Lambda 接受 ButtonEvent
button.poll_events([](device::ButtonEvent e) { /* ... */ }, HAL_GetTick());

// Lambda 接受 auto（泛型 lambda）
button.poll_events([](auto&& e) { /* ... */ }, HAL_GetTick());

// Lambda 接受 Pressed（variant 的一个选项）— 这不行！
// std::invocable<Callback, ButtonEvent> 检查的是用 ButtonEvent 调用，不是 Pressed
button.poll_events([](device::Pressed e) { /* ... */ }, HAL_GetTick());  // 编译错误
```

### Concepts vs. SFINAE

Before concepts, constraining template parameters relied on SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error):

```cpp
// SFINAE 方式 — 丑陋且难以理解
template <typename Callback,
          typename = std::enable_if_t<std::is_invocable_v<Callback, ButtonEvent>>>
void poll_events(Callback&& cb, uint32_t now_ms, uint32_t debounce_ms = 20);
```

The principle behind SFINAE is that if the condition in `std::enable_if_t` evaluates to false, the template is silently removed from the candidate list, and the compiler looks for other matching overloads. Only if no match is found at all does it report a "no matching function" error—and this error is usually accompanied by dozens of lines of template instantiation stack traces.

Concepts elevate constraints to first-class citizens of the language: the `requires` clause directly declares the constraint, the compiler directly checks it, and a constraint failure directly reports the constraint's name. There is no need to understand how SFINAE works under the hood.

## Is Callback&& an Rvalue Reference?

```cpp
void poll_events(Callback&& cb, ...)
```

`Callback&&` looks like an rvalue reference, but it is actually a **forwarding reference**. When `Callback` is a template parameter, the meaning of `Callback&&` depends on the argument passed in:

- If an lvalue is passed (such as a named lambda variable): `Callback` is deduced as `Lambda&`, and `Callback&&` becomes `Lambda& &&` which collapses to `Lambda&` (an lvalue reference)
- If an rvalue is passed (such as a temporary lambda): `Callback` is deduced as `Lambda`, and `Callback&&` is simply `Lambda&&` (an rvalue reference)

Therefore, `Callback&&` can accept anything—lvalues, rvalues, const, and non-const. This is exactly what we want: users can pass a temporary lambda or a named function object.

Why not use `const Callback&`? Because a `const` reference cannot invoke a non-const `operator()`. Even though our lambda does not modify captured variables, maintaining generality is safer.

In this scenario, we did not use `std::forward<Callback>(cb)`—because the callback is only invoked once inside `poll_events()`, so perfect forwarding is unnecessary. If `cb` is an lvalue, we just call it directly; if it is an rvalue, we also just call it directly. The role of the forwarding reference here is simply to "accept any callable object of arbitrary type," rather than to "perfectly forward" it.

## Full Code Walkthrough

Now let's walk through the execution flow of `main.cpp` from start to finish, examining what each line of code does.

```cpp
#include "device/button.hpp"
#include "device/button_event.hpp"
#include "device/led.hpp"
#include "system/clock.h"
extern "C" {
#include "stm32f1xx_hal.h"
}
```

Header file inclusions. `button.hpp` indirectly includes `gpio.hpp`. The `extern "C"` wrapper around the HAL header ensures the C++ compiler uses C linkage rules when looking up HAL functions (as covered in Part 12 of the LED tutorial).

```cpp
int main() {
    HAL_Init();
    clock::ClockConfig::instance().setup_system_clock();
```

System initialization. Exactly the same as the LED tutorial: initialize the HAL, and configure the system clock to 64MHz.

```cpp
    device::LED<device::gpio::GpioPort::C, GPIO_PIN_13> led;
    device::Button<device::gpio::GpioPort::A, GPIO_PIN_0> button;
```

Object construction. These two lines each do three things:

**LED Construction:**

1. `GPIOClock::enable_target_clock()` — `if constexpr` enables the GPIOC clock
2. `setup(Mode::OutputPP, NoPull, Low)` — configures PC13 as push-pull output
3. The object `led` is ready, providing the `on()`, `off()`, and `toggle()` interfaces

**Button Construction:**

1. `GPIOClock::enable_target_clock()` — `if constexpr` enables the GPIOA clock
2. `setup(Mode::Input, PullUp, Low)` — configures PA0 as input with pull-up resistor
3. `static_assert` validates the pin number — passes at compile time
4. The object `button` is ready, with the state machine's initial state set to `BootSync`

```cpp
    while (1) {
        button.poll_events(
            [&](device::ButtonEvent event) {
                std::visit(
                    [&](auto&& e) {
                        using T = std::decay_t<decltype(e)>;
                        if constexpr (std::is_same_v<T, device::Pressed>) {
                            led.on();
                        } else {
                            led.off();
                        }
                    },
                    event);
            },
            HAL_GetTick());
    }
```

Main loop. Each iteration does one thing: calls `button.poll_events()`.

**`HAL_GetTick()`** gets the current timestamp (in milliseconds) and passes it to the state machine for time-based evaluation.

**The callback lambda** `[&](device::ButtonEvent event)` captures `led` by reference. When the state machine confirms a state change, it invokes this lambda, where the parameter `event` is `std::variant<Pressed, Released>`.

**`std::visit`** dispatches based on the type held by `event`:

- If it is `Pressed`: calls `led.on()`
- If it is `Released` (the `else` branch): calls `led.off()`

**The Complete Call Chain:**

```text
main() 循环
  → poll_events(lambda, HAL_GetTick())
    → is_pressed() → read_pin_state() → HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_0)
    → switch(state_) 状态机判断
    → 确认变化时: cb(Pressed{}) 或 cb(Released{})
      → lambda 被调用，event = ButtonEvent
      → std::visit(lambda2, event)
        → if constexpr: led.on() 或 led.off()
          → HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13, ...)
```

From the moment the user presses the button to the LED lighting up, the sequence is: physical level change → IDR register update → `HAL_GPIO_ReadPin()` read → state machine debounce confirmation → `Pressed` event trigger → `std::visit` dispatch → `led.on()` → `HAL_GPIO_WritePin()` → ODR register update → LED on.

The entire process involves no virtual functions, no heap allocation, and no exception handling. Every layer is a compile-time-resolved inline call.

## Looking Back

This part completes the final piece of the C++ refactoring puzzle:

- **Concepts** (`requires std::invocable<Callback, ButtonEvent>`) constrain the callback signature, providing clear compilation errors
- **Forwarding references** `Callback&&` accept any callable object
- **Full code walkthrough** the entire call chain from `main()` to `HAL_GPIO_WritePin()`

So far, we have fully refactored the button control code using C++. The next part serves as the conclusion to this series—covering EXTI interrupt-driven buttons, along with a summary of common pitfalls and practice exercises.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: TX/RX Crossover Wiring

This is the number one issue in UART debugging, bar none.

**Symptom**: The terminal receives nothing, or doesn't receive the data being sent.

**Cause**: Connecting the adapter's TX to the Blue Pill's TX (PA9), and the adapter's RX to the Blue Pill's RX (PA10). TX to TX means both sides are transmitting and nobody is listening — of course nothing is received.

**Fix**: Remember "crossover wiring" — adapter TX to Blue Pill RX (PA10), adapter RX to Blue Pill TX (PA9). If you aren't sure which wire is TX and which is RX, swap them and try — it won't burn anything, it just won't work.

### Pitfall 2: Baud Rate Mismatch

**Symptom**: The terminal displays garbled text — looks like random characters.

**Cause**: The baud rate set in the code doesn't match the terminal software's baud rate. For example, the code uses 115200, but the terminal is set to 9600. UART is an asynchronous protocol; both sides must operate at the exact same rate, otherwise all sampling points will be misaligned and the read data will be completely wrong.

**Fix**: Confirm that the `UartConfig{.baud_rate = ...}` in the code exactly matches the terminal software's baud rate setting. It's not just the baud rate — data bits, parity bits, and stop bits must also match (standard configuration is 8N1).

### Pitfall 3: Ring Buffer Overflow

**Symptom**: The second half of a long string is lost during transmission, or command parsing occasionally fails.

**Cause**: The ISR pushes bytes faster than the main loop pops them. Once the 128-byte buffer is full, `push()` returns false, and bytes are dropped. This happens when the PC rapidly sends a large amount of data (like pasting a long block of text), while the main loop is busy handling other things (like button debounce or sending a response).

**Fix**: Increasing the buffer size is the most direct approach — change `CircularBuffer<128>` to `CircularBuffer<256>` or `CircularBuffer<512>`. Additionally, ensure there are no long-blocking operations in the main loop — each loop iteration should process all pending data as quickly as possible.

### Pitfall 4: Forgetting volatile on the Ring Buffer

**Symptom**: Seems to work fine, but occasionally loses data. Becomes more frequent when increasing the optimization level (`-O2`).

**Cause**: The `head_` and `tail_` of the `CircularBuffer` are not declared as `volatile`. During compiler optimization, the `head_` read in the main loop gets cached into a register, and subsequent loops no longer re-read from memory — the ISR's push operation becomes invisible to the main loop.

**Fix**: Ensure that `head_` and `tail_` are declared as `volatile size_t`. Our code already correctly uses `volatile` — but if you write your own ring buffer, don't forget this point.

### Pitfall 5: printf Floating-Point vs nano.specs

**Symptom**: `printf("%f", 3.14)` outputs garbled text or nothing at all.

**Cause**: Our CMakeLists.txt uses the `-specs=nano.specs` linker flag, which links against the streamlined C library (nano newlib). The streamlined version does not support floating-point printf formatting — format specifiers like `%f` and `%g` do not work.

**Fix**: Use integers to simulate floating-point output: `printf("%d.%02d", (int)(value * 100) / 100, (int)(value * 100) % 100)`. Alternatively, if Flash space is sufficient, remove `-specs=nano.specs` to link the full C library (Flash usage will increase by about 10-20 KB).

### Pitfall 6: Forgetting to Restart Reception in the Callback

**Symptom**: The first byte is received, but no further data is ever received.

**Cause**: Forgetting to call `restart_receive()` in the `HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback()`. HAL does not automatically start the next round after completing a single-byte reception — you must manually call `HAL_UART_Receive_IT()` to re-enable reception. If you forget, RXNEIE is not re-enabled, and the next arriving byte will not trigger an interrupt.

**Fix**: Ensure the last line in the callback is `restart_receive()`. This is the easiest step to miss in interrupt-driven reception — it doesn't throw errors or crash, it just "silently fails."

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Add a STATUS Command (Easy)

Add a new command `STATUS` in `handle_command()` that returns the current LED state (ON or OFF).

Hint: You need a way to track the LED's current state. The simplest method is to use a `bool` variable, updating it each time `led.on()` or `led.off()` is called. Alternatively, you could read the actual logic level of PC13 — but note that PC13 is active-low (the Blue Pill's onboard LED is active-low).

Goal: Type "STATUS" in the terminal, and the chip returns "LED is ON" or "LED is OFF". Understand how to extend the existing command processing framework.

### Exercise 2: ECHO Mode Toggle (Medium)

Implement an ECHO mode: when enabled, every received byte is immediately sent back as-is. Add "ECHO ON" and "ECHO OFF" commands to toggle the mode.

Hint: In the UART reception section of the main loop, add an `bool echo_mode = false` flag. When `echo_mode` is true, immediately `send_string()` each popped byte back. Note: the echo should happen before line parsing — after a byte is popped, echo it first, then append it to the line buffer.

Goal: After typing "ECHO ON", every character you type in the terminal will be echoed (you can see what you are typing). After typing "ECHO OFF", echoing stops. Understand how to add real-time response logic within the interrupt-reception + main-loop-consumption framework.

### Exercise 3: Interrupt-Driven Transmission + Transmit Ring Buffer (Challenge)

In our code, reception is interrupt-driven, but transmission is still blocking. This exercise requires you to implement interrupt-driven transmission.

Hint: You will need:

1. A transmit-direction ring buffer (`CircularBuffer<256> tx_ring`)
2. In the main loop, push to `tx_ring` instead of directly calling `HAL_UART_Transmit` when data needs to be sent
3. Start interrupt transmission: `HAL_UART_Transmit_IT(&huart, &byte, 1)`
4. In the `HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback()`, check if `tx_ring` still has data — if yes, keep sending; if no, stop
5. Pay attention to TXEIE (Transmit Interrupt Enable) management — only enable it when there is pending data, and disable it when done

The challenge of this exercise lies in the fact that transmission is "started on demand" — unlike reception, which runs continuously. You need to handle edge cases like "how to stop the interrupt when the ring buffer is empty" and "how to start sending the first byte."

Goal: Understand the symmetry between interrupt-driven transmission and reception, and master the complete interrupt-driven UART architecture with dual ring buffers.

## UART Tutorial Recap

We have completed 13 articles. Let's review our learning path:

**Phase 1: Motivation (Part 31)**

- Derived communication requirements from LED (output) and Button (input)
- What UART is, and why we chose it
- Final result preview and hardware preparation

**Phase 2: Hardware Fundamentals (Parts 32-33)**

- UART protocol details: start bit, data bits, parity bit, stop bit, baud rate, oversampling
- STM32 USART peripheral: three instances, key registers, GPIO alternate functions, NVIC preview

**Phase 3: HAL + Blocking I/O (Parts 34-35)**

- HAL initialization and blocking transmission
- printf redirection, the fatal problem with blocking reception

**Phase 4: Interrupt-Driven (Parts 36-38)**

- Cortex-M3 interrupt mechanism and NVIC
- Lock-free SPSC ring buffer
- UART IRQ handling and callback chain

**Phase 5: C++ Abstraction (Parts 39-42)**

- `std::expected` error handling
- UART driver template: zero-size abstraction, `if constexpr`, `static inline`
- Concepts constraints + UartManager
- Command processor and complete code walkthrough

**Phase 6: Summary (Part 43)**

- 6 common pitfalls and 3 progressive exercises

Summary of C++ features used:

- `std::expected<T, E>` (C++23) — type-safe error handling
- `std::span` (C++20) — safe contiguous memory view
- `std::string_view` (C++17) — zero-copy string view
- `consteval` (C++20) — compile-time baud rate validation
- Concepts (C++20) — constraining callback signatures
- `static inline` members (C++17) — template singletons
- `if constexpr` (C++17) — compile-time hardware dispatch
- `enum class : uintptr_t` — base address encoding
- `volatile` — ISR visibility guarantees
- `extern "C"` — ISR and printf bridging
- `[[maybe_unused]]` (C++17) — suppressing unused parameter warnings
- Designated initializer (C++20) — `UartConfig{.baud_rate = 115200}`

Every feature solved a real problem in the specific context of the UART driver. From error handling to type constraints, from compile-time dispatch to ISR bridging — modern C++ in the embedded domain is not "just for show"; it genuinely makes code safer, more maintainable, and more efficient.

With this, the UART tutorial is complete. We covered everything from protocol principles to interrupt-driven design, from C-style HAL calls to C++23 templates and Concepts. Your STM32 can now not only light up LEDs and read buttons on its own, but also communicate bidirectionally with a PC — this is a qualitative leap. Moving forward, whether you build SPI sensor drivers, read EEPROMs via I2C, or put together a complete embedded web server, UART communication will remain your foundational tool for debugging and verification.

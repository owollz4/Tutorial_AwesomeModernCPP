# std::shared_ptr（C++11）

## In a Nutshell

Multiple smart pointers can jointly own the same object. The object is automatically released only when the last owner is destroyed or reset.

## Header

`#include <memory>`

## Core API Quick Reference

| Operation | Signature | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Construction | `shared_ptr()` | Construct a null pointer (default) |
| Construction (factory) | `template<class T, class... Args> shared_ptr<T> make_shared(Args&&... args)` | Allocate and construct an object (C++11) |
| Reset | `void reset()` | Release ownership of the currently managed object |
| Get raw pointer | `T* get() const noexcept` | Return the stored pointer |
| Dereference | `T& operator*() const noexcept` | Dereference the stored pointer |
| Arrow operator | `T* operator->() const noexcept` | Access members through the pointer |
| Reference count | `long use_count() const noexcept` | Return the number of shared_ptrs sharing the object |
| Boolean conversion | `explicit operator bool() const noexcept` | Check if it manages a non-null object |
| Swap | `void swap(shared_ptr& r) noexcept` | Swap the objects managed by two shared_ptrs |

## Minimal Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
struct Foo { Foo() { std::cout << "Foo()\n"; } ~Foo() { std::cout << "~Foo()\n"; } };
int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<Foo> p1 = std::make_shared<Foo>();
    std::shared_ptr<Foo> p2 = p1; // 引用计数变为 2
    std::cout << "count: " << p1.use_count() << "\n";
    p1.reset(); // count: 1
    p2.reset(); // 析构 Foo
}
```

## Embedded Applicability: Medium

- Internally maintains a control block and atomic reference count, incurring extra memory and CPU overhead
- Copy operations are inherently thread-safe, making it suitable for sharing resources across multiple tasks
- Use with caution on MCUs with extremely limited RAM and Flash; prefer unique_ptr

# Understanding the Revolutionary Feature of C++20 — Coroutine Support Part 1

## What Are Coroutines?

First, to introduce coroutines, we must mention the runtime stack of a function: when a function is called, the runtime allocates a **stack frame** for it. This stack frame stores the parameters, return address, and local variables declared in the function — this is the function's runtime environment.

The core idea of a coroutine is: **a function can suspend in the middle of its execution, yielding control; when conditions are met, it can resume and continue executing from where it left off.** This allows us to implement lightweight cooperative scheduling in user space: different tasks switch in an orderly, program-controlled manner, rather than relying on the preemptive scheduling of OS threads.

Of course, we should clarify that, based on their implementation, there are two approaches to coroutines: **stackful coroutines** switch the entire execution stack; whereas **C++20 coroutines belong to the "stackless" paradigm** — the compiler packages the local variables and state that need to be preserved at the suspension point into a **coroutine frame**. Upon suspension, this coroutine frame is saved and control is returned; upon resumption, the state is restored from the frame and execution continues. Because there is no need to switch OS stacks, and usually no need to frequently enter kernel mode, this approach is obviously far superior to process/thread switching in extreme concurrency scenarios.

We typically use coroutines for three main reasons:

- **Writing asynchronous code in a synchronous style**: Complex callback chains can be replaced by linear, sequential code, making the logic more intuitive and readable.
- **High concurrency with low overhead**: Compared to threads, creating and switching coroutines is cheaper, making them ideal for large numbers of I/O-intensive concurrent tasks.
- **More flexible control flow expression**: Coroutines are inherently suited for implementing patterns like generators, pipelines, lazy evaluation, and asynchronous task chains.

## What Does C++ Coroutine Support Look Like?

Since this is a C++ blog, we inevitably need to discuss C++'s coroutine support. Unfortunately, I must emphasize that the C++20 coroutine interface is quite difficult to write. I've browsed various forums and read other developers' introductions to C++20 coroutines, and I have to admit — if we don't understand coroutines themselves, this set of interfaces is truly hard to grasp (I struggled with it for quite a while myself). Therefore, I highly recommend that while reading this blog, you practice the code and add some logging. This will help you understand what C++ coroutines are actually doing.

To elaborate on the above, I've decided to reorganize the introduction to coroutines.

> I know some of you haven't read about what coroutines are in C++ yet. You can check out the explanation of this interface on your own. I personally closed the page halfway through my first read and went to write other things — it's really quite hard to understand! 👉[协程 (C++20) - cppreference.cn - C++参考手册](https://cppreference.cn/w/cpp/language/coroutines)

After organizing everything, here is what we need to understand. You might want to keep these as notes. Or, if you don't want to read through it, you can skip to the next section and look at the examples — a quick glance will give you a general idea of how to use C++20 coroutines.

- There are three extended keywords provided by the compiler that we need to know first:

  - `co_await`: This keyword is used to suspend the coroutine until we **call a resumption mechanism to put it back down!** It's worth noting that our `co_await` must be followed by an expression. This expression is typically **an object that supports certain C++ coroutine interface conventions** (at least that's how I use it; there are many tricky C++ coroutine techniques out there that are genuinely confusing to read, so I'll just put it this way for the sake of beginner understanding). In plain English, the thing being awaited must implement functions with the given signatures — if it doesn't, the compiler will tell you the interface is missing!
  - `co_yield`: Used to pause execution and yield a value. What does this mean? When placed inside our coroutine function, it yields the value of the expression modified by `co_yield`. This value needs to be returned through an interface. Don't worry about the specifics yet; we'll cover that later.
  - `co_return`: Used to finish execution and return a value. At this point, when we write a `co_return`, the coroutine function ends and prepares to destroy our coroutine struct.

- Another part is a struct that a coroutine function needs to return (the **coroutine return type**). This struct is used to provide scheduling information to the coroutine framework. In practice, modern C++ uses interfaces to determine whether coroutines are supported, so what we need to do is declare an object type that **must embed `promise_type` — note that it must be exactly this name, it cannot be changed!**

  > ```cpp
  > // coroutine中
  > #if __cpp_concepts
  >     requires requires { typename _Result::promise_type; }
  >     struct __coroutine_traits_impl<_Result, void>
  > #else
  >     struct __coroutine_traits_impl<_Result,
  >        __void_t<typename _Result::promise_type>>
  > #endif
  >     {
  >       using promise_type = typename _Result::promise_type;
  >     };
  > ```

  The next step is to declare and implement the interfaces that must exist within this `promise_type`. Here is what we need to implement:

  | Interface (Function)                         | Purpose                                                         | Return Type Requirement                                                 |
  | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **1. `get_return_object()`**                | **Get return object**: The first function executed when a coroutine function is called. It is responsible for creating and returning the **return object** (such as your `Generator`) that the caller (the outside world) uses to interact with the coroutine. | Must return the coroutine function's return type (or something convertible to it). |
  | **2. `initial_suspend()`**                  | **Initial suspend point**: Determines whether the coroutine **executes immediately** or **suspends** upon creation. | Must return an **Awaitable** object (such as `std::suspend_always` or `std::suspend_never`). |
  | **3. `final_suspend()`**                    | **Final suspend point**: Determines whether the coroutine is **destroyed immediately** or **suspends** after finishing execution (`co_return` or end of function body). | Must return an **Awaitable** object. |
  | **4. `return_void()` or `return_value(V)`** | **Return value handling**: Used to handle the coroutine's **final value** or **final state**. | If the coroutine function returns `void` (for example, `Generator` often does this), you must provide `return_void()`. If the coroutine uses `co_return V;` to return a value, you must provide `return_value(V)`. These two are **mutually exclusive**. |
  | **5. `unhandled_exception()`**              | **Exception handling**: Called when an **uncaught exception** occurs inside the coroutine. | Must return `void`. |

  Of course, it's also worth mentioning that if your coroutine function uses the `co_yield` keyword, you need to implement one additional function:

  | Interface (Function)                | Purpose                                                         | Return Type Requirement                                                 |
  | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **`yield_value(T value)`** | **Yield value**: Called when the coroutine executes `co_yield T;`. It is responsible for storing the yielded value and suspending the coroutine. | Must return an **Awaitable** object (typically `std::suspend_always`). |

- Of course, there is another part we need to pay attention to. As you can see, we sometimes require returning `std::suspend_always` or `std::suspend_never`. Although this expresses whether we want to suspend the coroutine or not, this interface is not necessarily coupled with `promise_type` — it is actually independent of our `promise_type`. It also needs to satisfy an interface type, or rather, `std::suspend_always` and `std::suspend_never` describe behaviors that guide our scheduler — we can implement our own class satisfying the corresponding interface (`trait`) to tell the scheduler how to work — whether to suspend or not. Generally speaking, the interfaces that need to be satisfied are those of `Awaitable trait`, or more simply put, once you implement these three functions, the scheduler will know what you want to do:

  | Interface (Function)            | Purpose           | Explanation                                                         |
  | ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | **`await_ready()`**    | **Ready check** | **Determines whether suspension is needed**. If it returns `true`, it means "already ready, no need to wait," and the coroutine will **continue executing**, skipping `await_suspend`. If it returns `false`, it means "not yet ready, need to wait," and the coroutine will call `await_suspend()` to perform the suspension. |
  | **`await_suspend(H)`** | **Perform suspension**   | **Executes the logic for suspending the coroutine**. Called when `await_ready()` returns `false`. The parameter `H` is the handle of the current coroutine (`std::coroutine_handle<P>`). Inside this function, you can save the handle, place it into a task queue, and yield control. |
  | **`await_resume()`**   | **Resume execution**   | **Handles the return value after resumption**. When the coroutine is awakened (`resume`), this is the first function executed. It is responsible for returning the value the coroutine needs to use after resumption (if needed). |

Our subsequent exercises and explanations actually revolve closely around three compiler extended keywords, six necessary coroutine frame **object interfaces** (five if you don't use `co_yield`, excluding `yield_value`), and three **interface functions** of the `Awaitable` object returned by some of the coroutine frame object interfaces that guide the corresponding behavior.

## That Was Too Dry, Let's Look at an Example

To briefly illustrate our **coroutine workflow**, just looking at the notes above isn't enough to explain anything. We need to note that a function intended to use coroutines as its vehicle needs to define an interface like this:

```cpp
协程返回类型 函数名称(参数列表);

```

So we can quickly draft some code:

```cpp

bool quit_flag = 0; // 这个quit_flag用来标识Main的退出，这样我们才能看到咱们的协程的工作
int main() {
 dump_time();
 std::println("Ready to involk task()");
 auto result = task(); // 接受协程接口支持的栈帧结构体
 std::println("Result here: {}", result.value());
 while (!quit_flag) // 卡在这里，演示完整的流程
  ;

 std::println("Result here: {}", result.value());

 return 0;
}

```

> `dump_time` is a function I use to print execution events. Here is its definition, which we will also use later when printing.
>
> ```cpp
> void dump_time() {
>  auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
>  std::time_t currentTime = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(now);
>  std::tm localTime;
> #ifdef _WIN32
>  localtime_s(&localTime, &currentTime); // Windows 平台
> #else
>  localtime_r(&currentTime, &localTime); // Linux/Unix 平台
> #endif
>  std::cout << std::put_time(&localTime,
>                             "%H:%M:%S")
>            << " :";
> }
> ```

The next step is to define our coroutine return type. Note that the notes above already explained that our coroutine return type must have an embedded type named `promise_type`. Here is the type (note that this type must be public, as the scheduler will directly access these interface functions). Let's first look at what we need to write to make the function support running on a coroutine:

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct MyTask { // MyTask的名称是随意的
 struct promise_type {
        // promise_type不可以随
        // 在coroutine文件中已经要求了这个类型的存在

        // 返回的是咱们的协程返回类型，这个时候外界调用的协程函数返回的对象就是MyTask
        // 实际上就是保存咱们的协程相关的内容的结构体, 我们关心的一些结果就在这个返回的结构体中
        MyTask get_return_object() { ... }

        // 不挂起的版本, 返回的是 std::suspend_never, initial_suspend在上面的笔记中谈到
        // 他是用来协程栈帧首次被创建的时候, 用来告诉调度器要不要挂起的, suspend_never就是
        // 不要挂起，直接跑
        // 如果返回的是 std::suspend_always, 那就是创建完马上挂起，需要他跑起来，
        // 我们就需要手动放下，打个类比的话——Windows创建线程or进程您可以控制它到底运行不运行
        // 如果创建即挂起，那么后面我们调用resume接口就能解决这个问题, 方便起见这里不挂起
        std::suspend_never initial_suspend() { ... }

        // 这个是协程在执行完毕的时候，调度器会在对象本来应该析构的前夕，决定
        // 要不要挂起来这个协程，这里挂起是为了防止对象直接被析构干净了，我们方便检查点内容
        // 这里就先挂起，当然如果你的协程单纯的是做苦力，不保存任何其他东西，返回
        // std::suspend_never
        std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept { ... }

        // co_return的时候，调用的就是这个东西——说起来很简单，return的东西会立马被转发到
        // return_value里保存起来，我们后面使用的时候，就访问对应的MyTask类型保存的内容（
        // 一般而言，咱们都是扔到Task结构体中结束的）
        void return_value(T value) { ... }

        // 这个部分是如果我们直接throw了异常，编译器会把那些没有处理的异常扔到这个函数里
        // 一般我们不做任何处理，当然，如果您需要处理一部分异常，把你的实现放到这里
        void unhandled_exception() { }
    };
};

```

Below, I implement this struct — it essentially stores an `int` as the result, so naturally the code is written this way. It's worth noting that much of the code here is just printing logs.

```cpp
struct Task {
 struct promise_type {
  promise_type()
      : __value(std::make_shared<int>()) {
   dump_time();
   std::println("Task::promise_type::promise_type is involked!");
  }
  Task get_return_object() {
   dump_time();
   std::println("Task::promise_type::get_return_object is involked!");
   return Task { __value };
  }
  std::suspend_never initial_suspend() {
   dump_time();
   std::println("Task::promise_type::initial_suspend is involked!");
   return {};
  }
  std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept {
   // even though we returns the std::suspend_always
   // the co-ro will dashed after the quit flags are set as 1
   // main will quit, and you wont see the program stuck
   dump_time();
   std::println("Task::promise_type::final_suspend is involked!");
   return {};
  }
  void return_value(int value) {
   dump_time();
   std::println("Task::promise_type::return_value is involked!");
   *__value = value;
   /**
    *  Warning: dont write codes like that in
    * production env, this is unsafe
    */
   quit_flag = 1; // OK, main can quit then
  }
  void unhandled_exception() { }

 private:
  std::shared_ptr<int> __value;
 };

 Task(std::shared_ptr<int> v)
     : __value(v) {
  dump_time();
  std::println("Task is created!");
 }

 int value() const { return *__value; }

private:
 std::shared_ptr<int> __value;
};

```

Now our `task` function is ready to be implemented. We can put it below and take a look.

```cpp
Task task() {
 SimpleReader reader1;
 dump_time();
 std::println("CoAwait the reader1");
 int tol = co_await reader1;
 std::println("tol: {}", tol);

 SimpleReader reader2;
 dump_time();
 std::println("CoAwait the reader2");
 tol += co_await reader2;
 std::println("tol: {}", tol);

 SimpleReader reader3;
 dump_time();
 std::println("CoAwait the reader3");
 tol += co_await reader3;
 std::println("tol: {}", tol);

 dump_time();
 std::println("Ready to co_return");

 co_return tol;
}

```

We can see that `SimpleReader` is `co_await`, so `SimpleReader` must be an Awaitable object. As we mentioned earlier, an Awaitable object must satisfy three interfaces to guide the scheduler:

```cpp
struct SimpleReader {
    // await_ready是我们的co_await语句一执行，编译器立马就会转发到这个函数里来
    // false就表明，咱们的Awaitable对象没有预备好
    // 可以拿更加场景化的例子举例——IO事件没有准备，协程化的对象这里就要返回IO是否做好了
 bool await_ready() {
  dump_time();
  std::println("call await_ready, always return false");
  return false;
 }

    // 当我们调用恢复resume接口的时候，编译器立马就会转发到await_resume上，实际上我们要求返回的就是co_await的结果，task()代码中我们是int tol = co_await reader1, 所以，这里的return value就会直接返回给tol
 int await_resume() {
  dump_time();
  std::println("call await_resume, return the current value: {}", value);
  return value;
 }

    // 当我们的await_ready返回否的时候，编译器立马挂起协程，并且走处理回调await_suspend
    // 当然，编译器好心的帮助我们传递进来了协程的handle: std::coroutine_handle<>， 这个接口被
    // 用来协调 我们可以如何操作这个协程handle，笔者这里就决定扔到一个脱离主线程的子线程
    // 拿到value后直接放下协程继续执行
 void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) {
  dump_time();
  std::println("call await_suspend, creating a detached thread");
  std::thread worker([this, handle]() {
   std::this_thread::sleep_for(1s);
   value = 1;
   handle.resume(); // resume the await, will later involk await_resume
  });

  worker.detach();
 }

private:
 int value { 0 };
};

```

I've put the entire code in the appendix. You can now jump to Appendix 1 to check the code and think about the program's output.

After compiling and executing, we get the following log output. See if your prediction was correct?

```cpp

19:24:06 :Ready to involk task()
19:24:06 :Task::promise_type::promise_type is involked!
19:24:06 :Task::promise_type::get_return_object is involked!
19:24:06 :Task is created!
19:24:06 :Task::promise_type::initial_suspend is involked!
19:24:06 :CoAwait the reader1
19:24:06 :call await_ready, always return false
19:24:06 :call await_suspend, creating a detached thread
Result here: 0
19:24:07 :call await_resume, return the current value: 1
tol: 1
19:24:07 :CoAwait the reader2
19:24:07 :call await_ready, always return false
19:24:07 :call await_suspend, creating a detached thread
19:24:08 :call await_resume, return the current value: 1
tol: 2
19:24:08 :CoAwait the reader3
19:24:08 :call await_ready, always return false
19:24:08 :call await_suspend, creating a detached thread
19:24:09 :call await_resume, return the current value: 1
tol: 3
19:24:09 :Ready to co_return
19:24:09 :Task::promise_type::return_value is involked!
19:24:09 :Task::promise_type::final_suspend is involked!
Result here: 3

```

Comparing against your notes, you can easily figure out what happened in our code.

## Exercise 2: Using Coroutines to Write a Generator

The generator here mostly illustrates the coroutine's asynchronous preparation of results. When we need them, we request the expected content from the struct saved by the coroutine — it looks as if the coroutine conjured up what we wanted, which is how the generator gets its name.

Below, let's write our own generator to loop through and output every integer within a specified lower and upper bound. The signature convention is as follows:

```cpp
Generator<int> iterate_value(int start, int end) {
 // implement codes here
}

int main() {
 simple_log("Ready to start the range loop");

 for (int queried_value : iterate_value(1, 10)) {
  std::println("get the iterative value: {}", queried_value);
 }

 simple_log("the range loop Finished!");
}

```

#### Some Thoughts

If you're really stuck, listen to my thought process:

1. First, the problem here features the classic `for(int queried_value : iterate_value(1, 10))` style of code. Combined with STL conventions, any such `iteratable-for-loop` requires the iterated object to provide two interfaces: `begin` and `end`. Since this is a coroutine function, what's actually returned, as you can see from the interface, is `Generator<int>`, meaning the generator itself must satisfy the two iterable interfaces: `begin` and `end`.
2. The next question — when does the object become iterable? The answer is — when the coroutine suspends, the generator becomes iterable. Making the generator iterable when the coroutine suspends is too hard, so what if we think in reverse — can it work if the coroutine suspends when the generator calls `begin()`? This makes subsequent iteration easy too! When we iterate to the next item, we just suspend the coroutine to produce new content. When our coroutine finishes running, the generator naturally becomes non-iterable. At that point, it serves as `end()` — how about that?
3. The returned value obviously needs to be handled. At this point, what we have is the generator, not the value we care about — the iterator's `operator*` can clearly do the heavy lifting here. When we dereference it, we return the value we care about from the iterator — this is the very reason the iterator abstraction exists, right?
4. The lifecycle issue — should the coroutine be destroyed immediately upon `co_return`? Obviously not, because the values our generator cares about are still stored in the coroutine return type's handle. So let's think in reverse again — when the generator reaches the end of its lifecycle, our coroutine has obviously finished running as well. Having the generator destroy our coroutine is clearly the correct decision.

There's nothing novel about the code; I've placed it in the appendix.

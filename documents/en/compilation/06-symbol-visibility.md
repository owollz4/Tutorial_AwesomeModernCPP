# Deep Dive into C/C++ Compilation Technology — Shared Libraries A3: A Discussion on Symbol Visibility

Some readers might wonder—what exactly is symbol visibility? Is it the ``public`` or ``private`` keywords in C++? It is worth pointing out that it is not. The former is a basic feature provided alongside language syntax and compiler checks. Here, the symbol visibility we discuss is more aggressive, referring to visibility at the symbol ABI level.

#### Tips: How to View ABI Symbols

> Veterans can skip this section.

Since some readers might be encountering this article for the first time, they might not yet know how to "view the visible symbols contained in a given relocatable file, an executable composed of relocatable files, or a library file." I plan to specifically supplement how to perform this basic operation on major Windows and Linux platforms.

##### GNU/Linux Platform

This is very simple; we only need to use the `nm` tool. Suppose we have a library file ``libsome_helpers.so`` ready to be inspected. Entering the following command will do the trick.

```cpp

[charliechen@Charliechen runaable_dynamic_library]$ nm -D libsome_helpers.so
00000000000010e9 T add
                 w __cxa_finalize@GLIBC_2.2.5
                 w __gmon_start__
                 w _ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable
                 w _ITM_registerTMCloneTable
00000000000010fd T minus

```

##### Windows Platform

This is straightforward. Suppose I intend to inspect `CCWidget.dll`. To view the exported symbols, we use ``dumpbin /EXPORTS CCWidgets.dll``.

```cpp

D:\NewQtProjects\CCWidgetLibrary\build\Desktop_Qt_6_10_0_MSVC2022_64bit-Release\widgets>dumpbin /EXPORTS CCWidgets.dll
Microsoft (R) COFF/PE Dumper Version 14.44.35217.0

## How Do Mainstream Toolchains Control Symbol Visibility?

Getting back to the main topic, how do mainstream toolchains control symbol visibility? We will discuss this separately.

#### How to Control Symbol Visibility on GNU/Linux

##### Method 1: Directly pass -fvisibility to the compiler to control all symbol exports

The first method is the most brute-force approach. Suppose we have a private dependency project and do not want to expose any symbols at all. In this case, we can pass `-fvisibility` to gcc/g++ during compilation. By default, for the GNU C/C++ toolchain, **any symbol without any visibility modifier or specified visibility is public**. That is, ``-fvisibility=default``. If we want to hide them, we need to specify ``-fvisibility=hidden`` in the step of generating the shared library, and all symbols will not be exported. However, I have not used this myself; I have only found that this usage exists.

##### Method 2: The most common approach: using ``__attribute__((visibility(< "default" | "hidden" >)))``

I really like specifying it this way. Taking a simple logging library I wrote as a toy project as an example, for all APIs planned to be public at the ABI level, I forcefully specify ``__attribute__((visibility("default")))``. Conversely, for any symbol that should not be used, I apply ``__attribute__((visibility("hidden")))``.

```cpp

#ifdef CCLOG_BUILD_SHARED
#define CCLOG_API __attribute__((visibility("default")))
#define CCLOG_PRIVATE_API __attribute__((visibility("hidden")))
#else
#define CCLOG_API
#define CCLOG_PRIVATE_API
#endif

```

##### Method 3: Modifying a group of aggregated symbols with ``#pragma visibility push/pop``

If you really need to handle visibility modifications for a massive number of symbols on hand, but do not want to add the macros mentioned in my example above to each symbol one by one, you can use the compiler's preprocessor directives.

```cpp
#pragma visibility push("hidden")

int private_api_add(int a, int b);
int api_minus(int a, int b);

/* Remember to pop for preventing the leak of unwanted visibility decorations */
#pragma visibility pop

```

#### How Windows MSVC Handles This

Unfortunately, exporting symbols from Windows DLL shared libraries involves a relatively complex decoration mechanism. That is, for symbols planned for export, they need to be decorated with ``__declspec(dllexport)`` for export. Then, when using these symbols, we also need to mark them with ``__declspec(dllimport)``.

```cpp
#ifdef CCLOG_BUILD_SHARED
/* If we plan to exports sysbols to DLL, we need to decorate symbols by this */
/* Others in case can use the symbols */
#define CCLOG_API __declspec(dllexport)
#else
/* If we plan to import sysbols from DLL, we need to decorate symbols by this */
#define CCLOG_API __declspec(dllimport)
#end

```

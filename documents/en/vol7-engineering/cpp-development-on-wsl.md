# Quickly Developing General C++ Host Programs on WSL

## Preface

I distinctly remember writing a blog post like this before, but I can't find it anywhere. I'm about to start a new modern C++ analysis tutorial, so I plan to use this post to archive the environment setup process.

> Note: This article uses **WSL2 + Ubuntu (common)** as an example. Commands are run in PowerShell / Windows Terminal (Administrator) or the WSL bash shell. If you choose another distro (Debian, Fedora, etc.), replace the `apt` commands with the appropriate package manager.
>
> We won't cover how to install WSL here—there are plenty of tutorials available online.

------

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (latest updates recommended); enabling WSL2 is recommended (better performance, and it's the default for new installations). You can use `wsl --install` to install WSL and common distros in one step. ([Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Install Visual Studio Code on the Windows side (download and install from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- Have a Microsoft account / administrator privileges to enable virtualization features (Hyper-V / Virtual Machine Platform) if necessary.

## First Time in WSL: Update the System and Install Basic Build Tools

Open Windows Terminal -> select Ubuntu (or your installed distro) to enter the shell, then run:

```bash

# 更新系统包索引与系统
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# 安装 C/C++ 常用工具（gcc/g++、make 等）
sudo apt install -y build-essential gdb cmake ninja-build pkg-config

# 建议安装 clang/clang-format（可选）
sudo apt install -y clang clang-format

# （可选）安装额外工具：python 用于一些构建脚本、ccache 等
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip ccache

```

`build-essential` includes gcc/g++, make, and more. It's a very commonly used essential package for building on Debian/Ubuntu. See common community documentation for installation commands and details.

## Install VS Code on Windows and Enable the Remote - WSL Extension

1. Download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows.
2. Open VS Code, open the Extensions panel, search for and install:
   - **Remote - WSL** (or the official extension named *WSL*) — allows you to open and run VS Code directly in the WSL environment (the editor runs on Windows, but extensions/execution run on WSL). VS Code has official WSL development documentation and tutorials. (This extension is truly a lifesaver.)
3. We also recommend installing the following (the corresponding server-side extensions will be automatically installed in the WSL context later):
   - **C/C++ (ms-vscode.cpptools)**: Microsoft's official C/C++ extension, providing IntelliSense, debugging, code navigation, etc. Note that this extension conflicts with clangd. If you prefer the Clang toolchain, do not install this; instead, install Clangd and Clang-tidy.
   - **CMake Tools** (or C/C++ Extension Pack) — for CMake project management, configuration, building, switching kits, etc. If you don't use CMake, there are plenty of other VS Code extensions you'll need to search for yourself. Personally, I prefer using CMake.
   - **CodeLLDB** (if you prefer the lldb debugger)
   - **clang-format** support, GitLens (enhanced Git experience), EditorConfig, etc.

------

## Opening a Project in WSL with VS Code (Truly "Developing Under Linux")

1. Open VS Code in Windows, press `F1` -> type `Remote-WSL: New Window` (or navigate to the project directory in the Ubuntu terminal and run `code .`, which will open a VS Code window on WSL).
2. VS Code will automatically install the necessary server components in WSL, and the "green area in the bottom left corner" will display `WSL: <distro>`, indicating that the current window is connected to WSL.

> When VS Code is opened in the WSL context, the Extensions panel on the left will prompt you to install extensions "in WSL:Ubuntu" (meaning the extensions will be installed in the WSL environment rather than Windows). We recommend installing C/C++, CMake Tools, etc. on WSL (click "Install in WSL: Ubuntu").

------

## Creating a Minimal CMake + C++ Project and Building/Debugging it in VS Code

Create the project files in the WSL home directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/hello_cmake && cd ~/projects/hello_cmake

```

Create a new file named `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(hello_cmake LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
add_executable(hello main.cpp)

```

Create a new file named `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello from WSL C++ world!\n";
    int x = 42;
    std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```

Build (in the WSL terminal or VS Code's integrated terminal):

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -G "Ninja"        # 如果你安装了 ninja；否则用默认 make： cmake ..
cmake --build .
./hello

```

If you installed and are using the **CMake Tools** extension: open the project root directory, and the extension will provide `Configure` and `Build` buttons in the bottom status bar—just click them. You can also select different kits (gcc/clang) and build directories.

## Configuring Debugging in VS Code (Using GDB from ms-vscode.cpptools)

Create a `launch.json` file in the project's `.vscode` directory (using cpptools's `cppdbg`):

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Hello (gdb)",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/hello",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false,
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "/usr/bin/gdb",
      "setupCommands": [
        { "description": "Enable pretty-printing", "text": "-enable-pretty-printing", "ignoreFailures": true }
      ],
      "preLaunchTask": "CMake: build"
    }
  ]
}

```

The "program" field requires the file path of your application. `${workspaceFolder}` is the directory where you currently opened VS Code. Since the build output is placed in the `build` directory, you can find your generated application there.

If you use `tasks.json` to define a custom build task, ensure the `preLaunchTask` name matches. However, if you use CMake Tools, it will automatically create and manage build tasks/debug configurations, which is usually more convenient. In that case, switch to VS Code's debug panel and click

# std::vector Quick Start

In the previous chapters, we covered the core of the C++ language—type systems, control flow, functions, classes, and inheritance. Now we are entering a whole new territory: the Standard Template Library (STL). The STL provides a large collection of ready-made containers, algorithms, and iterators that save us from reinventing the wheel. Among all containers, `std::vector` is by far the most frequently used—a dynamic array that grows automatically, stores elements contiguously, and supports O(1) random access. Honestly, if you are not sure which container to use, just go with `vector`. Other containers only have an advantage in specific scenarios.

In this chapter, we will start from scratch and walk through `vector`'s construction, insertion, deletion, access, capacity management, and traversal. We will tie everything together with a hands-on task manager program at the end.

## Starting from Scratch — Constructing a vector

`std::vector` has several construction methods. Let's look at them one by one:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> v1;                    // empty vector
std::vector<int> v2(10);                // 10 elements, each initialized to 0
std::vector<int> v3(10, 42);            // 10 elements, each initialized to 42
std::vector<int> v4 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // initializer list
std::vector<int> v5(v4);                // copy constructor
std::vector<int> v6(std::move(v5));     // move constructor, takes over resources
```

One thing worth noting: `v2(10)` creates 10 elements, each with the value `int()` which is 0. This is not "reserving 10 slots with no elements"—there are actually 10 elements inside. Reserving space and having actual elements are two different concepts, which we will discuss in depth when we cover `reserve` later.

> **Pitfall Warning**: `vector<bool>` is a specialization of `vector` that compresses each `bool` into 1 bit to save space. This causes `vector<bool>` to behave differently from a regular `vector<T>` in many ways—for example, `operator[]` returns a proxy object instead of `bool&`. If you need a genuine bool array, use `vector<char>` or `deque<bool>` instead.

## Putting Things In — Adding Elements

The most commonly used operation for adding elements to a `vector` is `push_back`, which appends an element to the end. Starting from C++11, we also have `emplace_back`, which is more efficient than `push_back`—the difference is that `push_back` takes an already-constructed object, while `emplace_back` takes constructor arguments and constructs the object in-place within the vector's memory, saving one move or copy:

```cpp
struct Task {
    std::string name;
    int priority;
    Task(std::string n, int p) : name(std::move(n)), priority(p) {}
};

std::vector<Task> tasks;
tasks.push_back(Task("Write code", 1));   // constructs a temporary, then moves it
tasks.emplace_back("Test", 2);            // constructs in-place, no temporary needed
```

For simple types like `int` and `double`, there is virtually no performance difference between the two. But for classes with `std::string` or other members that require dynamic memory allocation, `emplace_back` can save an unnecessary construction and move. Make it a habit to prefer `emplace_back`.

If you need to insert an element at an arbitrary position in the middle, use `insert`:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40};
v.insert(v.begin() + 1, 15);  // v: {10, 15, 20, 30, 40}
```

However, note that inserting in the middle requires shifting all subsequent elements, giving an O(n) time complexity. If you find yourself frequently inserting at the front or middle of a vector, you might want to consider using `std::deque` or `std::list` instead.

> **Pitfall Warning**: Any operation that may cause a vector to reallocate memory (including `push_back`, `emplace_back`, and `insert`) invalidates all previously held iterators, pointers, and references. Consider this code:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
int* p = &v[0];       // pointer to the first element
v.push_back(4);       // may trigger reallocation!
// *p is now undefined behavior — the memory p points to may have been freed
```

If you need to hold a pointer or reference to an element in a vector, either ensure no reallocation-triggering operations will happen afterwards, or use an index for indirect access instead.

## Getting Things Out — Accessing Elements

`vector` provides several ways to access elements. The most commonly used is `operator[]`, which accesses elements by index just like a C array, without bounds checking. If you want bounds checking (throwing `std::out_of_range` on out-of-bounds access), use `at`:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
v[0] = 100;          // no bounds check
int y = v.at(10);    // throws std::out_of_range
```

In everyday development, `operator[]` is used more often, but in scenarios where user input or external data is used as an index, `at` provides a safety net.

There are also a few convenience access functions: `front()` returns a reference to the first element (equivalent to `v[0]`), `back()` returns a reference to the last element (equivalent to `v[v.size() - 1]`), and `data()` returns a pointer to the underlying array—since vector elements are stored contiguously, `v.data()` can be used directly as a C array, which is particularly handy when interfacing with C-style APIs.

> **Pitfall Warning**: Calling `front()`, `back()`, or `operator[]` on an empty vector is undefined behavior—it won't throw an exception but will plunge straight into UB territory. `at()` is the only method that performs bounds checking on an empty vector. So before calling `front()` or `back()`, either make sure the vector is not empty or check with `empty()` first.

## Removing What You Don't Need — Deleting Elements

The simplest operation is `pop_back`, which removes the last element and returns `void`—it does not return the removed value. If you need that value, use `back()` to get it before calling `pop_back`.

To remove an element in the middle, use `erase`, which accepts either an iterator or a range:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
v.erase(v.begin() + 2);                // v: {10, 20, 40, 50}
v.erase(v.begin() + 1, v.begin() + 3); // v: {10, 50}
```

To clear all elements at once, use `clear()`—after this, `size` becomes 0 but `capacity` remains unchanged, meaning the memory is not freed; only the elements are destroyed. If you also want to release the memory, you can use `shrink_to_fit` in combination.

### The Remove-Erase Idiom

Now here's the question: what if we want to remove all elements equal to a particular value? The answer is the remove-erase idiom, a classic C++ pattern:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5};
v.erase(std::remove(v.begin(), v.end(), 2), v.end());
// v: {1, 3, 4, 5}
```

`std::remove` doesn't actually delete elements—it moves all elements not equal to 2 to the front, then returns an iterator pointing to the "new logical end." The elements equal to 2 are pushed to the back. Then `erase` removes everything from the new end to the old end. The reason for this two-step approach is the STL design philosophy: "algorithms should not directly operate on container interfaces." `std::remove` only knows about iterators; it doesn't know about vector's `erase` method.

Starting from C++20, we can do this in a single line with `std::erase`: `std::erase(v, 2);`. If you are using a compiler that supports C++20, the new syntax is strongly recommended.

## Understanding size and capacity

`vector` has two easily confused concepts: `size` is the number of elements currently stored, while `capacity` is the number of elements the allocated memory can hold. `capacity` is always greater than or equal to `size`. When repeated `push_back` calls cause `size` to be about to exceed `capacity`, the vector automatically reallocates—allocating a larger block of memory, moving all elements over, and then freeing the old memory. Most standard library implementations double the `capacity` on each reallocation, so you will see capacity grow in this sequence: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ... Each reallocation involves a full memory allocation and the copy/move of all elements.

If you know roughly how many elements you will need in advance, using `reserve` to pre-allocate enough space can avoid the overhead of multiple reallocations:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v;
v.reserve(1000);  // one-time allocation, capacity becomes 1000, size remains 0

for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
    v.push_back(i);  // no reallocation triggered
}
```

`reserve` only affects `capacity`, not `size`. Conversely, if you want to release excess capacity, use `shrink_to_fit`—though this is a non-binding request, the standard does not guarantee memory will actually be released, but mainstream implementations generally do so.

## Going Through the Elements — Traversing a vector

There are three common ways to traverse a vector. The most recommended is the range-for loop (introduced in C++11), which is concise and safe:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

// Read-only traversal — make it a habit: always use const auto& for read-only access
for (const auto& elem : v) {
    std::cout << elem << " ";
}

// When you need to modify elements, drop the const
for (auto& elem : v) {
    elem *= 2;
}
```

Note that we use `const auto&` instead of `auto` here. For `int`, the difference is negligible, but when traversing a `vector<std::string>`, `auto` triggers a copy while `const auto&` is just a reference. If you need the index, use a traditional loop: `for (std::size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i)`. When you need to work with STL algorithms or need finer control, use iterators: `for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)`. In everyday development, range-for covers 90% of traversal needs.

## Hands-On Time — Building a Task Manager with vector

Let's combine all the knowledge points we've learned into a hands-on program—a task manager that supports adding tasks, marking them as completed and removing them, listing all tasks, and showing capacity information.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct Task {
    std::string description;
    bool done;
    Task(std::string desc) : description(std::move(desc)), done(false) {}
};

class TaskManager {
public:
    void add_task(const std::string& desc)
    {
        tasks_.emplace_back(desc);
        std::cout << "  Added: \"" << desc << "\"\n";
    }

    void complete_task(int index)
    {
        if (index < 0 || index >= static_cast<int>(tasks_.size())) {
            std::cout << "  Invalid index: " << index << "\n";
            return;
        }
        tasks_[index].done = true;
        std::cout << "  Completed: \"" << tasks_[index].description << "\"\n";
    }

    void remove_completed()
    {
        // remove-erase idiom: remove all tasks where done == true
        auto it = std::remove_if(tasks_.begin(), tasks_.end(),
            [](const Task& t) { return t.done; });
        int removed = static_cast<int>(tasks_.end() - it);
        tasks_.erase(it, tasks_.end());
        std::cout << "  Removed " << removed << " completed task(s)\n";
    }

    void list_all() const
    {
        if (tasks_.empty()) {
            std::cout << "  (no tasks)\n";
            return;
        }
        for (std::size_t i = 0; i < tasks_.size(); ++i) {
            std::cout << "  [" << i << "] "
                      << (tasks_[i].done ? "[x]" : "[ ]")
                      << " " << tasks_[i].description << "\n";
        }
    }

    void show_status() const
    {
        std::cout << "  size: " << tasks_.size()
                  << ", capacity: " << tasks_.capacity() << "\n";
    }

private:
    std::vector<Task> tasks_;
};

int main()
{
    TaskManager mgr;

    std::cout << "=== Adding tasks ===\n";
    mgr.add_task("Write vector tutorial");
    mgr.add_task("Review pull requests");
    mgr.add_task("Fix build warnings");
    mgr.add_task("Update documentation");

    std::cout << "\n=== All tasks ===\n";
    mgr.list_all();
    mgr.show_status();

    std::cout << "\n=== Completing tasks ===\n";
    mgr.complete_task(0);
    mgr.complete_task(2);

    std::cout << "\n=== Removing completed ===\n";
    mgr.remove_completed();

    std::cout << "\n=== Remaining tasks ===\n";
    mgr.list_all();
    mgr.show_status();

    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -o task_manager task_manager.cpp && ./task_manager
```

Expected output:

```text
=== Adding tasks ===
  Added: "Write vector tutorial"
  Added: "Review pull requests"
  Added: "Fix build warnings"
  Added: "Update documentation"

=== All tasks ===
  [0] [ ] Write vector tutorial
  [1] [ ] Review pull requests
  [2] [ ] Fix build warnings
  [3] [ ] Update documentation
  size: 4, capacity: 4

=== Completing tasks ===
  Completed: "Write vector tutorial"
  Completed: "Fix build warnings"

=== Removing completed ===
  Removed 2 completed task(s)

=== Remaining tasks ===
  [0] [ ] Review pull requests
  [1] [ ] Update documentation
  size: 2, capacity: 4
```

Note that `capacity` is still 4 at the end—`erase` does not release memory. This small detail is often overlooked in practice.

> **Pitfall Warning**: Calling `erase` on elements directly inside a range-for loop causes undefined behavior, because `erase` invalidates iterators. If you need to delete elements during traversal, either use an index-based loop iterating backwards, or use an iterator loop combined with the return value of `erase`. However, in most cases, marking first and then doing a unified remove-erase is a clearer approach, as shown in the `remove_completed` method above.

## Try It Yourself — Exercises

### Exercise 1: Frequency Counter

Given a vector of integers, count how many times each value appears. Hint: you can sort first and then traverse, or use a double loop (a simple implementation is fine; no need to use a map).

```cpp
std::vector<int> data = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5};
// Expected output: 1 appears 2 times, 2 appears 1 times, ...
```

### Exercise 2: Deduplication

Write a function that takes a sorted vector and returns a new vector with duplicates removed. Do not use `std::unique`; implement it manually.

```cpp
std::vector<int> deduplicate(const std::vector<int>& sorted);
// deduplicate({1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4}) -> {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### Exercise 3: Feel the Power of reserve

Insert 100,000 elements into a vector in two ways—without calling `reserve` and with `reserve(100000)`. Use `<chrono>` to time both approaches and compare the results. Experience the power of pre-allocating memory.

## Summary

In this chapter, we thoroughly covered the core operations of `std::vector`. Construction methods range from default construction to initializer lists to copy and move semantics. Insertion and deletion operations range from `push_back`/`emplace_back` to `erase` to the classic remove-erase idiom. Access methods range from `operator[]` to `at` to `data()`. Capacity management spans from the distinction between `size` and `capacity` to performance optimization with `reserve`. Finally, we tied all the knowledge points together through a hands-on task manager program.

Key takeaways: prefer `emplace_back` over `push_back`, be mindful of iterator invalidation caused by reallocation, understand the difference between `size` and `capacity` and call `reserve` when appropriate, and use the remove-erase idiom (or C++20's `std::erase`) when deleting elements that match a condition.

In the next chapter, we will look at `std::map` and `std::set`—when you need to look up by key or maintain a sorted collection, they are the go-to choices.

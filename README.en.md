## What This Project Is

<p align="center"><em>A systematic modern C++ tutorial — from syntax to silicon, bringing modern C++ to the desktop, STM32 embedded, and industrial open-source projects.</em></p>

10 volumes, 350+ articles, from C/C++ fundamentals through concurrency, performance, engineering, and domain practice — every key concept backed by a CMake example verified in CI, not an unbuildable snippet stranded in an article.

**Who is it for?** New to C/C++ · C or embedded background · Already know C++, want engineering depth

## Highlights

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center"><h4>🔧 From syntax to silicon</h4>Go beyond desktop C++ — hands-on STM32F1 embedded: register access, interrupt safety, zero-overhead abstraction, cross-compilation & linker scripts.</td>
    <td width="50%" align="center"><h4>⚡ Real, runnable examples</h4>CMake projects validated in CI — not unbuildable snippets stranded in articles.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><h4>📚 One complete path</h4>10 volumes, 350+ articles — fundamentals → modern features → standard library → advanced → concurrency → performance → engineering → domains.</td>
    <td align="center"><h4>🚀 C++23 current</h4>Covers and practices concepts, coroutines, ranges and more — not stuck at C++11.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><h4>🔍 Read real code, real talks</h4>Vol.9 studies Chromium (e.g. OnceCallback); Vol.10 is reading notes on CppCon and other talks.</td>
    <td align="center"><h4>🌐 Engineered + bilingual</h4>VitePress (search / dark mode / GitHub Pages auto-deploy) + Chinese main line + English translation + C++98→23 reference cards.</td>

## Start Here

The fastest path is to read the online docs:

- [Online documentation](https://awesome-embedded-learning-studio.github.io/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/en/)
- [C++ feature reference cards](https://awesome-embedded-learning-studio.github.io/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/en/cpp-reference/)
- [Embedded development track](https://awesome-embedded-learning-studio.github.io/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/en/vol8-domains/embedded/)
- [Community articles](https://awesome-embedded-learning-studio.github.io/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/en/community/)

Run the docs site locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awesome-Embedded-Learning-Studio/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP.git
cd Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP

pnpm install
pnpm dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/
```

Production build and preview:

```bash
BUILD_CONCURRENCY=8 pnpm build
pnpm preview
# Visit http://localhost:4173/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/
```

Every example is a standalone CMake project validated in CI — not an unbuildable snippet stranded in an article. Pick any directory and build it:

```bash
cmake -S code/examples/chapter05/06_array_vs_stdarray -B build && cmake --build build -j${nproc}
```

## Content Guide

The visual roadmap (ten-volume content map + learning paths by background) is integrated into the "Project Roadmap" section on the online docs home page:

### Volume overview

Core volumes are complete, advanced ones are still being filled in — progress in the open (counts are a snapshot and change as content grows):

| Volume | Topic | Articles | Maturity |
|--------|-------|:--------:|----------|
| Vol 1 | Fundamentals (incl. C crash-course) | 87 | ✅ Complete |
| Vol 2 | Modern features (RAII / smart pointers / move / lambda) | 44 | ✅ Complete |
| Vol 3 | Standard library in depth | 8 | 🔨 In progress |
| Vol 4 | Advanced (concepts / coroutines / templates) | 8 | 🔨 In progress |
| Vol 5 | Concurrency | 44 | ✅ Complete |
| Vol 6 | Performance | 3 | 🔨 In progress |
| Vol 7 | Engineering (CMake / toolchain / debugging) | 8 | 🔨 In progress |
| Vol 8 | Domains (embedded / networking / GUI / storage) | 63 | ✅ Complete |
| Vol 9 | Open-source code study (Chromium etc.) | 16 | 📚 Ongoing |
| Vol 10 | Talk & course notes (CppCon etc.) | 17 | 📚 Ongoing |

> Plus "Compilation & Linking" (11) and C++ feature reference cards (46). Most core volumes are complete; the rest are being filled in.

## What This Project Is

`Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP` is a continuously updated modern C++ learning project. It is not a collection of disconnected syntax notes: it connects language fundamentals, the standard library, modern features, engineering practice, and domain applications into one learning path, with compilable CMake examples for key concepts.

It is designed for:

- Learners building a systematic C/C++ foundation without relying on fragmented notes.
- C or embedded developers who want to use modern C++ in real engineering work.
- C++ developers who want to strengthen concurrency, performance, build systems, debugging, and source-code reading skills.

## Highlights

- **10-volume curriculum**: fundamentals, modern features, standard library, advanced topics, concurrency, performance, engineering, domains, open-source study, and lecture notes.
- **Compilable examples**: code samples are organized as CMake projects and validated in CI, not only shown as isolated snippets.
- **Embedded direction**: STM32F1 practice projects, resource constraints, peripheral abstraction, cross-compilation, and linker scripts.
- **Engineered docs site**: built with VitePress, with search, navigation, dark mode, local preview, and GitHub Pages deployment.
- **Bilingual content and reference cards**: Chinese-first content now has full English translation coverage, plus a C++98 to C++23 feature reference index.

## Start Here

The fastest path is to read the online docs:

- [Online documentation](https://awesome-embedded-learning-studio.github.io/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/en/)
- [C++ feature reference cards](https://awesome-embedded-learning-studio.github.io/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/en/cpp-reference/)
- [Embedded development track](https://awesome-embedded-learning-studio.github.io/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/en/vol8-domains/embedded/)

Run the docs site locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awesome-Embedded-Learning-Studio/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP.git
cd Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP

pnpm install
pnpm dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/
```

Production build and preview:

```bash
BUILD_CONCURRENCY=8 pnpm build
pnpm preview
# Visit http://localhost:4173/Tutorial_AwesomeModernCPP/
```
